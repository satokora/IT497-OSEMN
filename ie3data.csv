To achieve this flexibility, it may be worth examining an unconventional algorithm such as topological methods. Here, we propose a fully parallelized algorithm for a shape-invariant touch counter for 2-D pixels. The number of touches is counted by the Euler integral, a generalized integral, in which a connected component counter (Betti number) for the binary image was used as elemental module. Through examples of touches, we demonstrate transparently how the proposed circuit architecture embodies the Euler integral in the form of recurrent neural networks for iterative vector operations.

Heterodyne phase locking was achieved at a continuously tuneable offset frequency between 2 and 6 GHz. Thanks to the photonic integration, small dimensions, and custom-made electronics, the propagation delay in the loop was less than 1.8 ns, allowing good phase noise performance with OPLLs based on lasers with linewidths less than a few MHz.

Throughout this paper, it is argued that the application of SA is crucial for true comprehension and the correct use of traffic simulation models, but it is also acknowledged that the main obstacle toward an extensive use of the most sophisticated techniques is the high number of model runs usually required. For this reason, we have tested the possibility of performing a multistep SA, where, at each step, model parameters are grouped on the basis of possible common features, and a final SA on the parameters pertaining to the most influential groups is then performed. The proposed methodology was applied to an urban motorway case study simulated using MITSIMLab, a complex microscopic traffic simulator. The method allowed the analysis of the role played by all parameters and by the model stochasticity itself, with 80% fewer model evaluations than the standard variance-based approach. Ten model parameters accounted for a big share in the output variance for the specific case study. A Kriging metamodel was then estimated and integrated with the multistep SA results for a global calibration framework in the presence of uncertainty. Results confirm the great potential of this approach and open up to a novel view for the calibration of a traffic simulation model.","10.1109/TITS.2014.2302674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6757042&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757042","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1524-9050","6757042","Analytical models|Calibration|Computational modeling|Data models|Indexes|Mathematical model|Sensitivity","calibration|road traffic|sensitivity analysis|transportation","","1"

A key feature of this scheme is that an exact sample rate match is not required to recover the signal. This method is implemented in a custom wideband software defined radio, with good results in the presence of interference and multipath.

The complex permittivity measurements were performed on cells suspended in culture medium using an open-ended coaxial probe. Maxwell's mixture equation then allows the calculation of the permittivity profiles of the cells from the difference in permittivity between the cell suspensions and pure culture medium. The open-ended coaxial probe turned out to be very sensitive to disturbances affecting the measurements, resulting in poor precision. Permittivity differences were not large in relation to the spread of the measurements and repeated measurements were performed to improve statistics. The 95% confidence intervals were computed for the arithmetic means of the measured permittivity differences in order to test the statistical significance. The results showed that for bone cells at the lowest tested concentration (33 500/ml), there were significance in the real part of the permittivity at frequencies above 30 GHz, and no significance in the imaginary part. For the second lowest concentration (67 000/ml) there was no significance at all. For a medium concentration of bone cells (135 000/ml) there was no significance in the real part, but there was significance in the imaginary part at frequencies below about 25 GHz. The cell suspension with a concentration of 1 350 000/ml had significance in the real part for both high (above 30 GHz) and low (below 15 GHz) frequencies. The imaginary part showed significance for frequencies below 25 GHz. In the case of an osteosarcoma cell line with a concentration of 2 700 000/ml, only the imaginary part showed significance, and only for frequencies below 15 GHz. For muscle cells at a concentration of 743 450/ml, there was only significance in the imaginary part for frequencies below 5 GHz.

This allows the use of compact, air-insulated mechanical contacts that do not need to withstand significant arc erosion or provide arc quenching. As a result, the moving mass and the drive system for the switch may be dramatically reduced in size, leading to low inertia of the moving parts and resulting in very rapid operation times. An integrated, high-torque, low-mass permanent-magnet actuator is presented that provides detent (unpowered) contact force coupled with a cantilever spring contact system sized for an 11-kV 2-MVA onload tap changer.

However, the value of L<sub>un</sub> is susceptible to variation due to S/D implant lateral diffusion. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the impact of S/D implant lateral straggle on the performance of UDG-MOSFETs.

Parallel optics appears as a valid short-term solution. It is, however, not a viable solution in the long-term because of its complex optical packaging. Therefore, increasing effort is now put into the possibility of exploiting higher order modulation formats with increased spectral efficiency and reduced optical transceiver complexity. As these type of links are based on intensity modulation and direct detection, modulation formats relying on optical coherent detection can not be straight forwardly employed. As an alternative and more viable solution, this paper proposes the use of carrierless amplitude phase (CAP) in a novel multiband approach (MultiCAP) that achieves record spectral efficiency, increases tolerance towards dispersion and bandwidth limitations, and reduces the complexity of the transceiver. We report on numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations with capacity beyond 100 Gb/s transmission using a single externally modulated laser. In addition, an extensive comparison with conventional CAP is also provided. The reported experiment uses MultiCAP to achieve 102.4 Gb/s transmission, corresponding to a data payload of 95.2 Gb/s error free transmission by using a 7% forward error correction code.

The proposed model not only takes into account a number of factors, such as the spectrum-sensing scheme, the spatial distribution of secondary users, and the channel conditions, including shadowing and Nakagami fading, but also gives an exact mathematical expression of the influences from these factors.

The output constellations in SCM-PSM exhibit nonbijective quasi-Gaussian statistical distributions that asymptotically reach the Shannon capacity limit, showing up to 0.7 dB sensitivity improvement for 256-ary SCM-PSM with respect to 256-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The characteristic wave formation based on superposition of antipodal symbols and the lack of need for additional encoders for signal shaping, greatly reduces the transmitter and receiver processing complexity in comparison to conventional alternatives. Single-level coding strategy (SL-SCM) is employed in the framework of bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) for forward error correction. The fiber transmission system is characterized in terms of signal-to-noise ratio for back-to-back case and correlated with simulated results for ideal transmission over additive white Gaussian noise channel. Thereafter, successful demodulation and decoding after dispersion-unmanaged transmission over 240-km standard single mode fiber of dual-polarization 6-Gbaud 16-, 32- and 64-ary SCM-PSM is experimentally demonstrated.","10.1109/JLT.2014.2333235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6843879&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6843879","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0733-8724","6843879","Constellation diagram|Encoding|Optical fiber communication|Quadrature amplitude modulation|Receivers|Signal to noise ratio","Gaussian distribution|decoding|encoding|optical fibre communication|optical modulation","","1"

Second, we apply a coarse-to-fine power control mechanism, which recomputes the MSRs and gains. This step iterates until the target power saving is accurately accomplished.

This requires computationally efficient algorithms for feature extraction and clustering suitable for low-power hardware implementation. This paper describes a new feature extraction method for real-time spike sorting based on extrema analysis (namely positive peaks and negative peaks) of spike shapes and their discrete derivatives at different frequency bands. Employing simulation across different datasets, the accuracy and computational complexity of the proposed method are assessed and compared with other methods. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method in conjunction with online sorting (O-Sort) is 91.6%, outperforming all the other methods tested with the O-Sort clustering algorithm.

However, in real-world applications of interconnected rule bases, situations may arise when certain crucial antecedents are absent from given observations. If such missing antecedents were involved in the subsequent interpolation process, the final conclusion would not be deducible using conventional means. To address this important issue, a new approach named backward fuzzy rule interpolation and extrapolation (BFRIE) is proposed in this paper, allowing the observations, which directly relate to the conclusion to be inferred or interpolated from the known antecedents and conclusion. This approach supports both backward interpolation and extrapolation which involve multiple fuzzy rules, with each having multiple antecedents. As such, it significantly extends the existing fuzzy rule interpolation techniques. In particular, considering that there may be more than one antecedent value missing in an application problem, two methods are proposed in an attempt to perform backward interpolation with multiple missing antecedent values. Algorithms are given to implement the approaches via the use of the scale and move transformation-based fuzzy interpolation.

The objective of this paper is to develop technological tools that can be used to characterize a wheelchair user's driving behavior under various settings. In the experiments conducted, PWs are outfitted with a datalogging platform that records, in real-time, the 3-D acceleration of the PW. Data collection was conducted over 35 different activities, designed to capture a spectrum of PW driving events performed at different speeds (collisions with fixed or moving objects, rolling on incline plane, and rolling across multiple types obstacles). The data was processed using time-series analysis and data mining techniques, to automatically detect and identify the different events. We compared the classification accuracy using four different types of time-series features: 1) time-delay embeddings; 2) time-domain characterization; 3) frequency-domain features; and 4) wavelet transforms. In the analysis, we compared the classification accuracy obtained when distinguishing between safe and unsafe events during each of the 35 different activities. For the purposes of this study, unsafe events were defined as activities containing collisions against objects at different speed, and the remainder were defined as safe events. We were able to accurately detect 98% of unsafe events, with a low (12%) false positive rate, using only five examples of each activity. This proof-of-concept study shows that the proposed approach has the potential of capturing, based on limited input from embedded sensors, contextual information on PW use, and of automatically characterizing a user's PW driving behavior.","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2365773","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6940270&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940270","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2372","6940270","Accelerometers|Educational institutions|Electronic mail|Feature extraction|Sensors|Support vector machines|Wheelchairs","data loggers|handicapped aids|medical control systems|time series|time-frequency analysis|wavelet transforms|wheelchairs","","1"

In this paper, we consider the transmission of a confidential message from a source to a destination in a decentralized wireless network in the presence of randomly distributed eavesdroppers. The source-destination pair can be potentially assisted by randomly distributed relays. For an arbitrary relay, we derive exact expressions of secure connection probability for both colluding and noncolluding eavesdroppers. We further obtain lower bound expressions on the secure connection probability, which are accurate when the eavesdropper density is small. Using these lower bound expressions, we propose a relay selection strategy to improve the secure connection probability. By analytically comparing the secure connection probability for direct transmission and relay transmission, we address the important problem of whether or not to relay and discuss the condition for relay transmission in terms of the relay density and source-destination distance.

This trade off can be derived analytically using the Cramer-Rao type bounds, which imply the calculation and the inversion of the Fisher information matrix (FIM). The inverse of the FIM expresses the uncertainty associated to the tomogram, enabling the comparison of system designs. However, computing, storing and inverting the FIM is not practical with 3-D imaging systems. In order to tackle the problem of the computational load in calculating the inverse of the FIM, a method based on the calculation of the local impulse response and the variance, in a single point, from a single row of the FIM, has been previously proposed for system design. However this approximation (circulant approximation) does not capture the global interdependence between the variables in shift-variant systems such as SPECT, and cannot account e.g., for data truncation or missing data. Our new formulation relies on subsampling the FIM. The FIM is calculated over a subset of voxels arranged in a grid that covers the whole volume. Every element of the FIM at the grid points is calculated exactly, accounting for the acquisition geometry and for the object. This new formulation reduces the computational complexity in estimating the uncertainty, but nevertheless accounts for the global interdependence between the variables, enabling the exploration of design spaces hindered by the circulant approximation. The graphics processing unit accelerated implementation of the algorithm reduces further the computation times, making the algorithm a good candidate for real-time optimization of adaptive imaging systems. This paper describes the subsampled FIM formulation and implementation details. The advantages and limitations of the new approximation are explored, in comparison with the circulant approxima- ion, in the context of design optimization of a parallel-hole collimator SPECT system and of an adaptive imaging system (similar to the commercially available D-SPECT).","10.1109/TMI.2013.2292805","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6675890&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6675890","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0278-0062","6675890","Approximation methods|Cameras|Image reconstruction|Optimization|Single photon emission computed tomography|Uncertainty","adaptive systems|collimators|graphics processing units|image reconstruction|image sampling|medical image processing|optimisation|single photon emission computed tomography","","1"

Existing displacement amplification mechanisms are analyzed in terms of transmissibility and are characterized with two lumped-parameter elements: serial and parallel compliances. The maximum transmissibility is attained when the parallel stiffness and the serial compliance are zero. An existing flexure mechanism using structural buckling, that produces a large displacement but a low transmissibility, is replaced by a rolling-contact mechanism that approaches the maximum criterion. Furthermore, a mechanism is presented to apply a constant preload to each PZT stack despite their movement.

To further increase the aggregate capacity, the LDPC code is employed as an error correction mechanism that can allow more simultaneous users accommodated in the network. As the aggregate capacity and system complexity are the main considerations in practical system design, both of which are mutually trade off. Utilization of LDPC code and optical hard-limiter can effectively reduce the system complexity to reach the maximum aggregate capacity.

Each user is associated with a user-centric cluster of BSs; the central processor shares the user's data with the BSs in the cluster, which then cooperatively serve the user through joint beamforming. Under this setup, this paper investigates the user scheduling, BS clustering, and beamforming design problem from a network utility maximization perspective. Differing from previous works, this paper explicitly considers the per-BS backhaul capacity constraints. We formulate the network utility maximization problem for the downlink C-RAN under two different models depending on whether the BS clustering for each user is dynamic or static over different user scheduling time slots. In the former case, the user-centric BS cluster is dynamically optimized for each scheduled user along with the beamforming vector in each time-frequency slot, whereas in the latter case, the user-centric BS cluster is fixed for each user and we jointly optimize the user scheduling and the beamforming vector to account for the backhaul constraints. In both cases, the nonconvex per-BS backhaul constraints are approximated using the reweighted &#x2113;<sub>1</sub>-norm technique. This approximation allows us to reformulate the per-BS backhaul constraints into weighted per-BS power constraints and solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem through a generalized weighted minimum mean square error approach. This paper shows that the proposed dynamic clustering algorithm can achieve significant performance gain over existing naive clustering schemes. This paper also proposes two heuristic static clustering schemes that can already achieve a substantial portion of the gain.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2362860","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920005&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6920005","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6920005","Approximation methods|Array signal processing|Cloud computing|Downlink|Dynamic scheduling|Heuristic algorithms|Radio access networks","array signal processing|cloud computing|least mean squares methods|optimisation|pattern clustering|radio access networks","","1"

Achievability is based on the idea of phase alignment (PA) precoding, where instead of nulling out the destructive interference, it judiciously rotates the phases of the transmitted symbols. In this way, they add up coherently at the intended user and yield higher received SNRs. In addition, it is well known that regularized channel inversion (RCI) precoding improves the performance of channel inversion (CI) in multiantenna downlink communications. In line with this and similar to the RCI precoding, in this paper, we propose the idea of regularized PA (RPA), which is shown to improve the performance of original PA precoding. To do this, we first rectify the original PA precoding, deriving a closed-form expression to evaluate the amount of transmit-power reduction achieved for the same average output SNR compared with CI precoding. We then use this new analysis to select the appropriate regularization factor for our proposed RPA scheme. It is shown by means of theoretical analysis and simulations that the proposed RPA precoding outperforms CI, RCI, and PA precoders from both symbol error rate (SER) and throughput perspectives and provides a more power-efficient alternative. This is particularly pronounced as the number of transmit antennas becomes larger, where up to a 50-times reduction in the transmit power is achieved by RPA (PA) compared with RCI (CI) precoding for a given performance.","10.1109/TVT.2014.2317716","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6799269&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6799269","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9545","6799269","Covariance matrices|Downlink|Interference|Receiving antennas|Signal to noise ratio|Transmitting antennas|Vectors","antenna arrays|energy conservation|error statistics|precoding|radiofrequency interference|telecommunication power management|wireless channels","","1"

This paper combines generalized functions (specifically the Dirac delta function), superdense time, modal models, and constructive semantics to get a rich, flexible, efficient, and rigorous approach to modeling such systems. It shows that many physical scenarios that have been problematic for modeling techniques manifest as nonconstructive models, and that constructive versions of some of the models properly reflect uncertainty in the behavior of the physical systems that plausibly arise from the principles of the underlying physics. This paper argues that these modeling difficulties are not reasonably solved by more detailed continuous models of the underlying physical phenomena. Such more detailed models simply shift the uncertainty to other aspects of the model. Since such detailed models come with a high computational cost, there is little justification in using them unless the goal of modeling is specifically to understand these more detailed physical processes.

Numerous studies have indicated that flexible job-shop scheduling problems (FJSPs) and the distributed and FJSPs (DFJSPs) belong to NP-hard puzzle. The allocation of jobs to appropriate factories or flexible manufacturing units is an essential task in multifactory optimization scheduling, which involves the consideration of equipment performance, technology, capacity, and utilization level for each factory or manufacturing unit. Several variables and constraints should be considered in the encoding problem of DFJSPs when using genetic algorithms (GAs). In particular, it has been reported in the literature that the traditional GA encoding method may generate infeasible solutions or illegal solutions; thus, a specially designed evolution process is required. However, in such a process, the diversity of chromosomes is lost. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a refined encoding operator that integrates probability concepts into a real-parameter encoding method. In addition, the length of chromosomes can be substantially reduced using the proposed algorithm, thereby, saving computation space. The proposed refined GA algorithm was evaluated with satisfactory results through two-stage validation; in the first stage, a classical DFJSP was adopted to show the effectiveness of the algorithm, and in the second stage, the algorithm was used to solve a real-world case. The real-world case involved the use of historical data with 100 and 200 sets of work orders of a fastener manufacturer in Taiwan. The results were satisfactory and indicated that the proposed refined GA algorithm could effectively overcome the conflicts caused by GA encoding algorithms.","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2388486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7004149&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004149","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","7004149","Biological cells|Encoding|Genetic algorithms|Job shop scheduling|Manufacturing|Production facilities","computational complexity|fasteners|flexible manufacturing systems|genetic algorithms|job shop scheduling|probability","","1"

We start by showing that inference (and autopoiesis) are emergent features of any (weakly mixing) ergodic random dynamical system. We then apply the emergent dynamics to action and perception in a way that casts action as the fulfillment of (Bayesian) beliefs about the causes of sensations. More formally, we formulate ergodic flows on global random attractors as a generalized descent on a free energy functional of the internal states of a system. This formulation rests on a partition of states based on a Markov blanket that separates internal states from hidden states in the external milieu. This separation means that the internal states effectively represent external states probabilistically. The generalized descent is then related to classical Bayesian (e.g., Kalman-Bucy) filtering and predictive coding-of the sort that might be implemented in the brain. Finally, we present two simulations. The first simulates a primordial soup to illustrate the emergence of a Markov blanket and (active) inference about hidden states. The second uses the same emergent dynamics to simulate action and action observation.","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2306251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767058&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767058","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9219","6767058","Active filters|Bayes methods|Biological systems|Cognitive science|Markov processes|Mathematical model|Self-organizing networks","Markov processes|belief networks|cognitive systems|inference mechanisms","",""

The core cost function of the algorithm is the frame potential, a scalar property of matrices that measures the orthogonality of its rows.

In this feasibility investigation, we proposed a coarse-to-fine method based on a compressive-tracking algorithm for estimation of MT changes during an example task of isometric knee extension using ultrasound images. The sensitivity and efficiency are evaluated with 1920 US images from quadriceps muscle (QM) in eight subjects.

Written self-report anxiety measures are available; however, these indices tend to be time consuming to acquire. For medical patients, completing written reports can be burdensome if they are weak, in pain, or in acute anxiety states. Consequently, simple and fast non-invasive methods for assessing stress response from neurophysiological data are essential. In this paper, we report on a study that makes predictions of the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) index from oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentration changes of the prefrontal cortex using a two-channel portable near-infrared spectroscopy device. Predictions are achieved by constructing machine learning algorithms within a Bayesian framework with nonlinear basis function together with Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation. In this paper, prediction experiments were performed against four different data sets, i.e., two comprising young subjects, and the remaining two comprising elderly subjects. The number of subjects in each data set varied between 17 and 20 and each subject participated only once. They were not asked to perform any task; instead, they were at rest. The root mean square errors for the four groups were 6.20, 6.62, 4.50, and 6.38, respectively. There appeared to be no significant distinctions of prediction accuracies between age groups and since the STAI are defined between 20 and 80, the predictions appeared reasonably accurate. The results indicate potential applications to practical situations such as stress management and medical practice.","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2361757","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6917199&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6917199","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2372","6917199","Bayes methods|Educational institutions|Feature extraction|Indexes|Machine learning algorithms|Prediction algorithms|Stress","Bayes methods|Markov processes|Monte Carlo methods|bio-optics|biochemistry|blood|brain|diseases|geriatrics|infrared spectroscopy|learning (artificial intelligence)|medical signal processing|molecular biophysics|neurophysiology|proteins","","1"

Forty participants drove an instrumented vehicle over a 50-min mixed-route driving scenario. Two conditions were adopted: one is a control with no smart driving feedback offered and the other is with advice being presented to the driver via a smartphone in the vehicle. Key findings from the study showed a 4.1% improvement in fuel efficiency when using the smart driving aid, importantly with no increase in journey time or reduction in average speed. Primarily, these efficiency savings were enabled by limiting the use of lower gears (facilitated by planning ahead to avoid unnecessary stops) and an increase in the use of the fifth gear (as advised by the in-vehicle system). Significant and important changes in driving safety behaviors were also observed, with an increase in mean headway to 2.3 s and an almost threefold reduction in time spent traveling closer than 1.5 s to the vehicle in front.

One such challenge is an increase in temporal variability in measured behavioral and neural responses, which often results in suboptimal classification performance. Previously, we reported a novel classification method designed to account for temporal variability in the neural response in order to improve classification performance by using sliding windows in hierarchical discriminant component analysis (HDCA), and demonstrated a decrease in classification error by over 50% when compared to the standard HDCA method (Marathe et al., 2013). Here, we expand upon this approach and show that embedded within this new method is a novel signal transformation that, when applied to EEG signals, significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio and thereby enables more accurate single-trial analysis.

The selection of the parameter values is itself a combinatorial optimization problem. Although a considerable number of investigations have been conducted with regards to parameter selection, it is known to be a tedious task. In this paper, a DE algorithm is proposed that uses a new mechanism to dynamically select the best performing combinations of parameters (amplification factor, crossover rate, and the population size) for a problem during the course of a single run. The performance of the algorithm is judged by solving three well known sets of optimization test problems (two constrained and one unconstrained). The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only saves the computational time, but also shows better performance over the state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed mechanism can easily be applied to other population-based algorithms.","10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281528","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6600821&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6600821","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1089-778X","6600821","Algorithm design and analysis|Equations|Heuristic algorithms|Optimization|Sociology|Statistics|Vectors","computational complexity|evolutionary computation|optimisation|parameter estimation","","1"

Natural signals are assumed to be formed by the superposition of distinct time-frequency components, with the analytic goal being to infer these components by application of Bayes' rule. The framework serves to unify various existing models for natural time-series; it relates to both the Wiener and Kalman filters, and with suitable assumptions yields inferential interpretations of the short-time Fourier transform, spectrogram, filter bank, and wavelet representations. Value is gained by placing time-frequency analysis on the same probabilistic basis as is often employed in applications such as denoising, source separation, or recognition. Uncertainty in the time-frequency representation can be propagated correctly to application-specific stages, improving the handing of noise and missing data. Probabilistic learning allows modules to be co-adapted; thus, the time-frequency representation can be adapted to both the demands of the application and the time-varying statistics of the signal at hand. Similarly, the application module can be adapted to fine properties of the signal propagated by the initial time-frequency processing. We demonstrate these benefits by combining probabilistic time-frequency representations with non-negative matrix factorization, finding benefits in audio denoising and inpainting tasks, albeit with higher computational cost than incurred by the standard approach.","10.1109/TSP.2014.2362100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6918491&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918491","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1053-587X","6918491","Hidden Markov models|Noise|Noise reduction|Probabilistic logic|Spectrogram|Time-frequency analysis|Uncertainty","Bayes methods|Fourier transforms|Kalman filters|Wiener filters|channel bank filters|matrix decomposition|source separation|time-frequency analysis","",""

The analytical expressions and optimizations of the circuits give us relations between dc-energy-per-bit and receiver sensitivity, which can be compared to recent published low-power receivers.

This paper proposes DBA, a dynamic Bloom filter array aimed at representing membership for variable large data sets in storage systems in a scalable way. DBA consists of dynamically created groups of space-efficient Bloom filters (BFs) to accommodate changes in set sizes. Within a group, BFs are homogeneous and the data layout is optimized at the bit level to enable parallel access and thus achieve high query performance. DBA can effectively control its query accuracy by partially adjusting the error rate of the constructing BFs, where each BF only represents an independent subset to help locate elements and confirm membership. Further, DBA supports element deletion by introducing a lazy update policy. We prototype and evaluate our DBA scheme as a scalable fast index in the MAD2 deduplication storage system. Experimental results reveal that DBA (with 64 BFs per group) shows significantly higher query performance than the state-of-the-art approach while scaling up to 160 BFs. DBA is also shown to excel in scalability, query accuracy, and space efficiency by theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation.","10.1109/TPDS.2013.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6471979&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6471979","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1045-9219","6471979","Arrays|Distributed databases|Error analysis|Indexes|Peer-to-peer computing|Random access memory|Servers","cloud computing|data handling|data structures|query processing","","1"

In addition, EPPP4SMS is faster on the meter side-and in the whole round (encryption, aggregation, and decryption)-than other protocols based on homomorphic encryption and it is still scalable. Moreover, EPPP4SMS enables energy suppliers and customers to verify the billing information and measurements without leaking private information. Since the energy supplier knows the amount of generated electricity and its flow throughout electrical substations, the energy supplier can use this verification to detect energy loss and fraud. Different from verification based on digital signature, our verification enables new features; for example, smart meters and their energy supplier can compute the verification without storing the respective encrypted measurements. Furthermore, EPPP4SMS may be suitable to many other scenarios that need aggregation of time-series data keeping privacy protected, including electronic voting, reputation systems, and sensor networks. In this paper, we present theoretical results of EPPP4SMS and their validation by implementation of algorithms and simulation using real-world measurement data.","10.1109/TSG.2014.2336265","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6862920&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6862920","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1949-3053","6862920","Encryption|Power system security|Privacy|Protocols|Smart meters|Time series analysis","cryptographic protocols|data privacy|power system security|smart meters|smart power grids|substations|time series","","1"

With tensor extension operator, various types of data are represented as subtensors and then are merged to a unified tensor. In order to extract the core tensor which is small but contains valuable information, an incremental high order singular value decomposition (IHOSVD) method is presented. By recursively applying the incremental matrix decomposition algorithm, IHOSVD is able to update the orthogonal bases and compute the new core tensor. Analyzes in terms of time complexity, memory usage, and approximation accuracy of the proposed method are provided in this paper. A case study illustrates that approximate data reconstructed from the core set containing 18% elements can guarantee 93% accuracy in general.

Our approach first learns character representations from document patches without supervision. For learning, we use a probabilistic generative model parameterizing pattern features, their planar arrangements and their variances. The model's latent variables describe pattern position and class, and feature occurrences. Model parameters are efficiently inferred using a truncated variational EM approach. Based on the learned representation, a clean document can be recovered by identifying, for each patch, pattern class and position while a quality measure allows for discrimination between character and non-character patterns. For a full Latin alphabet we found that a single page does not contain sufficiently many character examples. However, even if heavily corrupted by dirt, we show that a page containing a lower number of character types can efficiently and autonomously be cleaned solely based on the structural regularity of the characters it contains.

For practicality, instead of the well-known wire medium, the uniaxial strip medium (USM) was proposed and used as the effective bulk material with a negative dielectric constant to support the spoof SPP modes. The relevant formulations, including the modal dispersion relations and the formulation for the waves in a multilayer anisotropic structure, are analytically presented in this paper. Interestingly, instead of taming and suppressing the spatial dispersion (SD), which had been done in most past studies, SD was exploited in the proposed structure to enhance the field confinement of the spoof SPP mode by approximately 41%. Moreover, the thickness of the USM slab could be reduced by 50%, using conductor backing and without perturbing the odd mode. This method and SD can help avoid electromagnetic interactions among various components of a multilayer printed circuit board structure and help miniaturize sensors or surface-wave waveguides in the microwave regime. In this study, the subwavelength thickness of the proposed structure was only 0.09 &#x03BB;<sub>0</sub> at 1.34 GHz. Additionally, the propagation loss for such slow-wave structures has seldom been discussed analytically and quantitatively. In this study, through calculations and simulations, low attenuation constants in the spoof SPP propagation direction of the proposed structures were investigated.

Significant measurement errors can be resulted due to the following facts: 1) a photometer with a diffuser generally has a spatial response that is stronger in the center of the detector; and 2) LED angular distributions of intensity often have a sidelobe about the central axis rather than a central peak. A special measuring facility for illuminance intensity distribution of LEDs and spatial response distribution of photometers has been designed. An evaluation factor &#x201C; c&#x201D; has been introduced to describe the spatial response distribution uniformity of photometers. Three kinds of photometers with different spatial response distribution were used to measure the averaged LED intensity individually. Experiment shows that the photometer with a diffuser has a response distribution of a cosine function, and the illuminance intensity distribution of LEDs generally presents a sine, trapezoidal, or cosine function with the 6.5 <sup>&#x00B0;</sup> field of view for CIE Condition B. The results show that the measurement errors could be more than -5.10% when using the photometer with a diffuser to measure the average intensity of LEDs with a narrow beam angle. It is very important that the uniformity of spatial response distribution of the photometer should be considered when calibrating Averaged LED Intensity as it can introduce a significant error.","10.1109/JPHOT.2013.2295458","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6690231&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690231","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6690231","Apertures|Detectors|Light emitting diodes|Light sources|Optical filters|Semiconductor device measurement|Standards","calibration|light emitting diodes|measurement errors|photodetectors|photometers","","1"

BBDDs are binary decision diagrams where the branching condition, and its associated logic expansion, is biconditional on two variables. Empowered by reduction and ordering rules, BBDDs are remarkably compact and unique for a Boolean function. The interest of such representation form in modern electronic design automation (EDA) is twofold. On the one hand, BBDDs improve the efficiency of traditional EDA tasks based on decision diagrams, especially for arithmetic intensive designs. On the other hand, BBDDs represent the natural and native design abstraction for emerging technologies where the circuit primitive is a comparator, rather than a simple switch. We provide, in this paper, a solid ground for BBDDs by studying their underlying theory and manipulation properties. Thanks to an efficient BBDD software package implementation, we validate (1) speed-up in traditional decision diagrams applications with up to 4.4 &#x00D7; gain with respect to other DDs, and (2) improved synthesis of circuits in emerging technologies, with about 32% shorter critical path than state-of-art synthesis techniques.","10.1109/JETCAS.2014.2361058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924810&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6924810","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2156-3357","6924810","Binary decision diagrams|Boolean functions|Design automation|Digital circuits","Boolean functions|binary decision diagrams|comparators (circuits)|electronic design automation|software packages","","1"

A traditional view of neural information processing suggests that neurons compute in a highly parallel and distributed manner, in which the cooperation of many weak synaptic inputs is necessary to activate a single neuron. Recent experiments, however, have shown that not all synapses are weak in cortical circuits, but some synapses are extremely strong (several tens of times larger than the average weight). In fact, the weights of excitatory synapses between cortical excitatory neurons often obey a lognormal distribution with a long tail of strong synapses. Here, we review some of our important and recent works on computation with sparsely distributed synaptic weights and discuss the possible implications of this synaptic principle for neural computation by spiking neurons. We demonstrate that internal noise emerges from long-tailed distributions of synaptic weights to produce stochastic resonance effect in the reverberating synaptic pathways constituted by strong synapses. We show a spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule and other mechanisms that produce such weight distributions. A possible hardware realization of lognormally connected networks is also shown.","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2306254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6767040&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767040","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9219","6767040","Biological neural networks|Integrated circuit modeling|Memory|Neurons|Noise measurement|Principal component analysis|Stability analysis|Stochastic resonance|Stochastic systems","bioelectric potentials|brain|log normal distribution|medical computing|neural nets|neurophysiology|stochastic processes","","1"

The experimental results indicated that the adjustment factor for blue light can enable the blue light spectrum to fit well with the measured spectrum. The adjustment factor was linearly related to the transmission ratio of the blue light. The blue light emitted by the blue die and the green light emitted by the phosphor were simulated and predicted in an accurate way as compared with the experimental measurements.

Refractivity retrieval was originally developed for a single radar and was recently extended for a network of radars by solving a constrained least squares (CLS) minimization. In practice, the number of high-quality ground returns can be often limited, and consequently, the retrieval problem becomes ill-conditioned. In this paper, an emerging technology of compressive sensing (CS) is proposed to estimate the refractivity field using a network of radars. It has been shown that CS can provide an optimal solution for the underdetermined inverse problem under certain conditions and has been applied to different fields such as magnetic resonance imaging, radar imaging, etc. In this paper, a CS framework is developed to solve the inversion. The feasibility of CS for refractivity retrieval using single and multiple radars is demonstrated using simulations, where the model refractivity fields were obtained from the Advanced Regional Prediction System. The root-mean-squared error was introduced to quantify the performance of the retrieval. The performance of CS was assessed statistically and compared to the CLS estimates for various amounts of measurement errors, numbers of radars, and model refractivity fields. Our preliminary results have shown that CS can consistently provide relatively robust and high-quality estimates of the refractivity field.","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2266277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6553149&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6553149","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0196-2892","6553149","","atmospheric humidity|atmospheric measuring apparatus|atmospheric techniques|meteorological radar|remote sensing by radar","","1"

To evaluate this, we focus on the ferric iron crystal field absorption, located at about 900 nm (F900), because it is impacted by both environmental and sensor effects. The consistency with which the wavelength position of F900 can be determined from imagery acquired in laboratory and field settings is evaluated under artificial and natural illumination, respectively. The wavelength position of F900, determined from laboratory imagery, is also evaluated as an indicator of the proportion of goethite in mixtures of crushed rock. Results are compared with those from a high-resolution field spectrometer. Images describing the wavelength position of F900 showed large amounts of spatial variability and contained an artifact-a consistent shift in the wavelength position of F900 to longer wavelengths. These effects were greatly reduced or removed when wavelength position was determined from a polynomial fit to the data, enabling wavelength position to be used to map hematite and goethite in samples of ore and on a vertical surface (a mine face). The wavelength position of F900 from a polynomial fit was strongly positively correlated with the proportion of goethite (R<sup>2</sup>=0.97). Taken together, these findings indicate that the wavelength position of absorption features from VNIR imagery should be determined from a polynomial (or equivalent) fit to the original data and not from the original data themselves.","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2266672","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6553103&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6553103","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0196-2892","6553103","","geophysical image processing|hyperspectral imaging|minerals|position measurement|rocks","","1"

Most research handles the static database in batch mode to discover the desired sequential patterns. In the past, the fast updated (FUP) and Fast UPdated 2 (FUP2) concepts were adopted to, respectively, maintain and update the discovered sequential patterns with sequence insertion and sequence deletion based on the designed FUP sequential pattern (FUSP)-tree structure. Based on the FUP or FUP2 concepts, original customer sequences are required to be rescanned if it is necessary to maintain and update the unpromising (small) sequences from the original database. In the past, pre-large concept was designed to keep the prelarge itemsets as the buffer to avoid the database rescan each time whether transaction insertion or deletion in the dynamic databases. In this paper, the prelarge concept is adopted to handle the discovered sequential patterns with sequence deletion. An FUSP tree is first built to keep only the frequent 1-sequences from the original database. The prelarge 1-sequences are also kept in a set for later maintenance approach. When some sequences are deleted from the original database, the proposed algorithm is then performed to divide the kept frequent 1-sequences and prelarge 1-sequences from the original database and the mined 1-sequences from the deleted customer sequences into three parts with nine cases. Each case is then processed by the designed algorithm to maintain and update the built FUSP tree. When the number of deleted customer sequences is smaller than the safety bound of the prelarge concept, the original customer sequences are unnecessary to be rescanned, but the sequential patterns can still be actually maintained and updated. Experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of execution time and the number of tree nodes.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2373433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6965610&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965610","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6965610","Algorithm design and analysis|Data mining|Database systems|Pattern recognition|Sequential analysis|Tree data structures","data mining|tree data structures","","1"

The fundamental structure is based on a half-wavelength (&#x03BB;/2) resonator with a center-tapped open-stub. Microwave varactors placed at various internal nodes separately adjust the filter's center frequency and bandwidth over a wide tuning range. The constant absolute bandwidth is achieved at different center frequencies by maintaining the distance between the in-band transmission poles. Meanwhile, the coupling strength could be compensable by tuning varactors that are side and embedding loaded in the parallel coupled microstrip lines (PCMLs). As a demonstrator, a second-order filter with seven tuning varactors is implemented and verified. A frequency range of 0.58-0.91 GHz with a 1-dB bandwidth tuning from 115 to 315 MHz (i.e., 12.6%-54.3% fractional bandwidth) is demonstrated. Specifically, the return loss of passbands with different operating center frequencies can be achieved with same level, i.e., about 13.1 and 11.6 dB for narrow and wide passband responses, respectively. To further verify the etch-tolerance characteristics of the proposed prototype filter, another second-order filter with nine tuning varactors is proposed and fabricated. The measured results exhibit that the tunable fitler with the embedded varactor-loaded PCML has less sensitivity to fabrication tolerances. Meanwhile, the passband return loss can be achieved with same level of 20 dB for narrow and wide passband responses, respectively.","10.1109/TMTT.2014.2337287","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6862071&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6862071","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9480","6862071","Bandwidth|Couplings|Microstrip|Passband|Resonant frequency|Tuning|Varactors","UHF filters|band-pass filters|microstrip filters|varactors","","1"

In a heterogeneous distributed shared-memory multiprocessor system, an important problem is how to assign processors to real-time application tasks, allocate data to local memories, and generate an efficient schedule in such a way that a time constraint can be met and the total system energy consumption can be minimized. We propose an optimal approach, i.e., an integer linear programming method, to solve this problem. As the problem has been conclusively shown to be computationally very complicated, we also present two heuristic algorithms, i.e., task assignment considering data allocation (TAC-DA) and task ratio greedy scheduling (TRGS), to generate near-optimal solutions for real-time applications in polynomial time. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms by comparing them with a greedy algorithm that is commonly used to solve heterogeneous task scheduling problems. Based on our extensive simulation study, we observe that our algorithms exhibit excellent performance. We conducted experimental performance evaluation on two heterogeneous multiprocessor systems. The average reduction rates of the total energy consumption of the TAC-DA and TRGS algorithms to that of the greedy algorithm are 13.72% and 15.76%, respectively, on the first system, and 19.76% and 24.67%, respectively, on the second system.

For instance, big data is commonly unstructured and require more real-time analysis. This development calls for new system architectures for data acquisition, transmission, storage, and large-scale data processing mechanisms. In this paper, we present a literature survey and system tutorial for big data analytics platforms, aiming to provide an overall picture for nonexpert readers and instill a do-it-yourself spirit for advanced audiences to customize their own big-data solutions. First, we present the definition of big data and discuss big data challenges. Next, we present a systematic framework to decompose big data systems into four sequential modules, namely data generation, data acquisition, data storage, and data analytics. These four modules form a big data value chain. Following that, we present a detailed survey of numerous approaches and mechanisms from research and industry communities.

Compared with other forms of interferences such as nonuniform illumination and pose changes, face with occlusions has not attracted enough attention yet. A novel approach, coined dynamic image-to-class warping (DICW), is proposed in this work to deal with this challenge in FR. The face consists of the forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, and chin in a natural order and this order does not change despite occlusions. Thus, a face image is partitioned into patches, which are then concatenated in the raster scan order to form an ordered sequence. Considering this order information, DICW computes the image-to-class distance between a query face and those of an enrolled subject by finding the optimal alignment between the query sequence and all sequences of that subject along both the time dimension and within-class dimension. Unlike most existing methods, our method is able to deal with occlusions which exist in both gallery and probe images. Extensive experiments on public face databases with various types of occlusions have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2359632","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6906281&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906281","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1556-6013","6906281","Biometrics (access control)|Face recognition|Facial features|Image recognition|Time warp simulation","face recognition|image sequences|interference|visual databases","","1"

We found numerically that the DS spectrum moving, together with spectrum narrowing/broadening, is caused by the effective gain profile change resulted from the moving of the artificial spectral filter. Furthermore, we show that the wavelength switching observed in the laser is a natural consequence of the effective gain switching. The moving of the artificial spectral filter could be originated from either the cavity birefringence change or the polarizer rotation. Due to the broad gain and the artificial birefringent filter introduced by the NPR technique, apart from the central wavelength shifting and bandwidth changing, wavelength switching of DSs could be obtained by simply rotating the polarizer. Numerical simulations well reproduced the experimental observations. Our results suggest that extra effort should be made for wavelength tuning if there is any polarization-dependent component in the cavity as the wavelength switching will interrupt the continuously wavelength shift.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2298405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704764&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6704764","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6704764","Band-pass filters|Bandwidth|Cavity resonators|Laser mode locking|Optical fiber dispersion|Optical fiber polarization|Tuning","fibre lasers|optical solitons|ytterbium","","1"

It is revealed that the representation of DUCG can be incomplete and the exact probabilistic inference may still be made. A real application of DUCG for fault diagnoses of a generator system of a nuclear power plant is demonstrated, which involves variables. Most inferences take with a laptop computer.

The performance of the OpenMP and GPU approaches were compared with a conventional Matlab implementation of NCC.

Recently, computerized methods have been rapidly evolving in the area of digital pathology, with growing applications related to nuclei detection, segmentation, and classification. In cancer research, these approaches have played, and will continue to play a key (often bottleneck) role in minimizing human intervention, consolidating pertinent second opinions, and providing traceable clinical information. Pathological studies have been conducted for numerous cancer detection and grading applications, including brain, breast, cervix, lung, and prostate cancer grading. Our study presents, discusses, and extracts the major trends from an exhaustive overview of various nuclei detection, segmentation, feature computation, and classification techniques used in histopathology imagery, specifically in hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining protocols.

By using the properties of Gaussian functions, an approximate approach to the APP detection is devised with the idea that, in the computation of the APP of each symbol, the remaining symbols are distinguished based on their contributions to the APP of the concerned symbol, and the symbols with less contributions are approximated as (continuous) Gaussian variables [hence the name partial Gaussian approximation (PGA)] to reduce the computational complexity. The connection between the PGA detector and the reduced dimension maximum a posteriori detector (RDMAP) is investigated. It is shown that, PGA is equivalent to RDMAP, but it has a complexity much lower than that of RDMAP, i.e., PGA can be regarded as an efficient implementation of RDMAP. In addition, the application of PGA in intersymbol interference (ISI) channel equalization is also investigated. We show that PGA allows further significant complexity reduction by exploiting the circulant structure of the system transfer matrix, which makes PGA very attractive in handling severe ISI channels with large memory length.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2322078","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6810827&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6810827","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6810827","Approximation methods|Communication systems|Computational complexity|Detectors|Electronics packaging|Encoding|Gaussian approximation","Gaussian processes|MIMO communication|approximation theory|computational complexity|equalisers|intersymbol interference|maximum likelihood detection|probability","","1"

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and applicability of GP models for music genre classification and music emotion estimation. These are two of the main tasks in the music information retrieval (MIR) field. So far, the support vector machine (SVM) has been the dominant model used in MIR systems. Like SVM, GP models are based on kernel functions and Gram matrices; but, in contrast, they produce truly probabilistic outputs with an explicit degree of prediction uncertainty. In addition, there exist algorithms for GP hyperparameter learning-something the SVM framework lacks. In this paper, we built two systems, one for music genre classification and another for music emotion estimation using both SVM and GP models, and compared their performances on two databases of similar size. In all cases, the music audio signal was processed in the same way, and the effects of different feature extraction methods and their various combinations were also investigated. The evaluation experiments clearly showed that in both music genre classification and music emotion estimation tasks the GP performed consistently better than the SVM.

Extensive experiments, using different wavelength lights and white light with variation light intensities, respectively, reported in this paper, showed that almost all light spectra can acquire acceptable pulse rates, but only 470-, 490-, 505-, 590-, 600-, 610-, 625-, and 660-nm wavelength lights showed better performance in PPGi waveform compared with gold standard. With lower light intensity, the light spectra &gt;600 nm still showed better performance. The change in pulse amplitude (ac) and dc amplitude was also investigated with the different light intensity and light spectra. With increasing light intensity, the dc amplitude increased, whereas ac component showed an initial increase followed by a decrease.

The effective use and recycling of such an ambient electromagnetic energy are the most relevant and critical issue for the current and future practicability of wireless energyharvesting devices and systems. In this paper, a set of performance criteria and development considerations, required to meet the need of applications of ambient electromagnetic energy harvesting, are also derived from the radiating source analysis. The criteria can be calculated from a simple measurement of the I-V nonlinear behavior of RF rectification devices such as diodes and transistors, as well as linear frequency behavior (S-parameters). The existing rectifying devices are then reviewed in light of the defined performance criteria. Finally, a technological outlook of the performances that can be expected from different device technologies is assessed and discussed.

Since more and more dispersed generators are installed on the demand side of power systems and they are reconfigured frequently, developing automatic approaches is indispensable for effectively managing a large-scale distribution network. Existing fast methods employ local updates that gradually improve the loss to solve such an optimization problem. However, they eventually get stuck at local minima, resulting in arbitrarily poor results. In contrast, this paper presents a novel optimization method that provides an error bound on the solution quality. Thus, the obtained solution quality can be evaluated in comparison to the global optimal solution. Instead of using local updates, we construct a highly compressed search space using a binary decision diagram and reduce the optimization problem to a shortest path-finding problem.

This paper presents a method that utilizes residuals from harmonic regression over years of Landsat data, in conjunction with statistical quality control charts, to signal subtle disturbances in vegetative cover. These charts are able to detect changes from both deforestation and subtler forest degradation and thinning. First, harmonic regression residuals are computed after fitting models to interannual training data. These residual time series are then subjected to Shewhart X-bar control charts and exponentially weighted moving average charts. The Shewhart X-bar charts are also utilized in the algorithm to generate a data-driven cloud filter, effectively removing clouds and cloud shadows on a location-specific basis. Disturbed pixels are indicated when the charts signal a deviation from data-driven control limits. The methods are applied to a collection of loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda) stands in Alabama, USA. The results are compared with stands for which known thinning has occurred at known times. The method yielded an overall accuracy of 85%, with the particular result that it provided afforestation/deforestation maps on a per-image basis, producing new maps with each successive incorporated image. These maps matched very well with observed changes in aerial photography over the test period. Accordingly, the method is highly recommended for on-the-fly change detection, for changes in both land use and land management within a given land use.","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2272545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6573358&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573358","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0196-2892","6573358","Control charts|Earth|Harmonic analysis|Indexes|Remote sensing|Satellites|Time series analysis","clouds|control charts|forestry|land use|quality control|regression analysis|time series|vegetation mapping","","1"

Sch., Monterey, CA, USA","Access, IEEE","6287639","2014","2","","","725","756","6860223","In this paper, we introduce a novel but intuitive scheme to recover multiple signals of interest (SoI) from multiple emitters in signal collection applications such as signal intelligence, electronic intelligence, and communications intelligence. We consider a case where the SoIs form a heavy interference environment. The scheme, which is referred to as reference-based successive interference cancellation (RSIC), involves a combination of strategic receiver placement and signal processing techniques. The scheme works by placing a network of cooperative receivers where each receiver catches its own SoI (despite multiple interferences). The first receiver demodulates the initial SoI (called a reference signal) and forwards it to the second receiver. The second receiver collects a received signal containing the second SoI but is interfered with by the initial SoI, which is a problem called co-channel interference in cellular communications. Unfortunately, the amplitude scaling of the interference is unknown in the second receiver and therefore has to be estimated via least squares error. It turns out that the estimation requires a priori knowledge of the second SoI, which is the very signal it tries to demodulate, thereby yielding a Catch-22 problem. We propose using an initial guess on the second SoI to form an amplitude estimate such that the interference is subtracted (cancelled) from the collected measurement at the second receiver. The procedure is applied to a third receiver (or multiple receivers) until the last of the desired SoI is separated from all of the co-channel interferences. The RSIC scheme performs well. Using quaternary phase shift keying as example modulation, we present major symbol error rate (SER) performance improvements with the use of RSIC over the highly degraded SER of receivers that are heavily interfered and do not employ any cancellation technique.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2340874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6860223&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6860223","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6860223","Interchannel interference|Interference cancellation|Least squares approximation|Phase shift keying|Receivers|Signal processing","amplitude estimation|cellular radio|cochannel interference|cooperative communication|error statistics|interference suppression|least squares approximations|phase shift keying|radio receivers|signal processing","","1"

In the proposed optimized deskew-filter method, the estimation accuracy of the nonlinear phase is improved by the higher orders of Taylor expansion and the high accuracy of the estimation of the time delay in the auxiliary interferometer using a cepstrum.

In a nonlinear elastic optical network, these parameters are inherently coupled with the routing algorithm. We propose to use congestion aware routing in a nonlinear elastic optical network and demonstrate its efficacy for the NSFNET reference network (14 nodes, 22 links). The network is sequentially loaded with 100 GbE demands until a demand becomes blocked, this procedure being repeated 10000 times to estimate the network blocking probability (NBP). Three routing algorithms are considered: 1) shortest path routing; 2) simple congestion aware algorithm; and 3) weighted congestion aware routing algorithm with 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 GHz resolution flexgrids. For NBP = 1% using a 50 GHz grid, congestion aware routing doubles the network capacity compared with the shortest path routing. When congestion aware routing is combined with a 6.25 GHz resolution flexgrid, a fivefold increase in network capacity is afforded.","10.1109/LPT.2014.2314438","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6781032&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781032","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1041-1135","6781032","Fiber nonlinear optics|Optical fiber amplifiers|Optical fiber networks|Routing|Signal to noise ratio","error statistics|nonlinear optics|optical fibre networks|optical modulation|optical transceivers|telecommunication network routing","","1"

Over the past several decades, many albedo products are generated from remote-sensing data sets. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/Albedo algorithm is used to routinely produce eight day (16-day composite), 1-km resolution MODIS albedo products. When some natural processes or human activities occur, the land-surface broadband albedo can change rapidly, so it is necessary to enhance the temporal resolution of albedo product. We present a direct-estimation algorithm for mapping daily land-surface broadband albedo from MODIS data. The polarization and directionality of the Earth's reflectance-3/polarization and anisotropy of reflectances for atmospheric sciences coupled with observations from a Lidar BRDF database is employed as a training data set, and the 6S atmospheric radiative transfer code is used to simulate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectances. Then a relationship between TOA reflectances and land-surface broadband albedos is developed using an angular bin regression method. The robustness of this method for different angular bins, aerosol conditions, and land-cover types is analyzed. Simulation results show that the absolute error of this algorithm is ~ 0.009 for vegetation, 0.012 for soil, and 0.030 for snow/ice. Validation of the direct-estimation algorithm against in situ measurement data shows that the proposed method is capable of characterizing the temporal variation of albedo, especially when the land-surface BRDF changes rapidly.","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2245670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6514500&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514500","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0196-2892","6514500","","atmospheric radiation|geophysical techniques|remote sensing","","1"

Depending on the width of the waveguide and the orientation of the silicon crystal, the linear wavelength shift per applied strain varies between 0.5 and 0.75 pm/microstrain for infrared light around 1550 nm wavelength. The influence of the increasing ring circumference is about three times larger than the influence of the change in waveguide effective index, and the two effects oppose each other. The strong dispersion in 220 nm high silicon sub-wavelength waveguides accounts for a decrease in sensitivity of a factor 2.2 to 1.4 for waveguide widths of 310 nm to 860 nm.

These vectors, known as i-Vectors, are lower dimensional representations of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) mean super-vectors adapted from a Universal Background Model (UBM) using speech utterance features, and extracted utilizing a Factor Analysis (FA) framework. This method is based on the assumption that the speaker dependent information resides in a lower dimensional sub-space. In this study, we utilize a mixture of Acoustic Factor Analyzers (AFA) to model the acoustic features instead of a GMM-UBM. Following our previously proposed AFA technique (&#x201C;Acoustic factor analysis for robust speaker verification,&#x201D; by Hasan and Hansen, IEEE Trans. Audio, Speech, Lang. Process., vol. 21, no. 4, April 2013), this model is based on the assumption that the speaker relevant information lies in a lower dimensional subspace in the multi-dimensional feature space localized by the mixture components. Unlike our previous method, here we train the AFA-UBM model directly from the data using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This method shows improved robustness to noise as the nuisance dimensions are removed in each EM iteration. Two variants of the AFA model are considered utilizing an isotropic and diagonal covariance residual term. The method is integrated within a standard i-Vector system where the hidden variables of the model, termed as acoustic factors, are utilized as the input for total variability modeling.

This could cause a large increase in the attenuation coefficient of the mode. This is called the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) effect. This paper discusses that graphene needs to be treated as an anisotropic material that has an almost real surface-normal dielectric constant component. Then, the ENZ effect does not exist.

As a result, significant challenges are imposed to identify the cause of link congestion between any pair of switch ports that may severely damage the overall network performance. Generally, it is expected that the granularity of the flow monitoring to diagnose network congestion in 5G DCNs needs to be down to the flow level on a physical port of a switch in real time with high-estimation accuracy, low-computational complexity, and good scalability. In this paper, motivated by a comprehensive study of a real DCN trace, we propose two sketch-based algorithms, called &#x03B1;-conservative update (CU) and P(d)-CU, based on the existing CU approach. &#x03B1;-CU adds no extra implementation cost to the traditional CU, but successfully trades off the achieved error with time complexity. P(d)-CU fully considers the amount of skew for different types of network services to aggregate traffic statistics of each type of network traffic at an individual, horizontally partitioned sketch. We also introduce a way to produce the real-time moving average of the reported results. By theoretical analysis and sufficient experimental results on a real DCN trace, we extensively evaluate the proposed and existing algorithms on their error performance, recall, space cost, and time complexity.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2349000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6879489&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6879489","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6879489","Algorithm design and analysis|Data centers|IP networks|Next generation networking|Ports (Computers)|Radiation detectors|Scability|Telecommunication traffic","Internet|computational complexity|computer centres|computer network reliability|mobile communication|telecommunication congestion control|telecommunication traffic","","1"

Furthermore, each input of the WSS can be assigned to any combination of output subcarrier frequencies, including frequencies unrelated to the modal frequencies of the comb source. This is especially useful for testing in-service ultra-high bandwidth systems by applying additional wavelengths.

As for the maintenance and repair of transformers, the major importance is the techniques for locating a PD source. The transfer function-based (TF) method for power transformers' winding in the high-frequency range is commonly used in power engineering applications, such as transient analysis, insulation coordination, and in transformer design. Although it is possible to localize PD in transformer winding using the transfer function (TF) method, this method cannot be used for transformers with no design data. Previous attempts toward finding a feature that localizes PD in transformers in general that lineate with PD location were found to be less successful. Therefore, in this paper, a neuro-fuzzy technique that uses unsupervised pattern recognition was proposed to localize PD source in power transformers. The proposed method was tested on a medium-voltage transformer winding in the laboratory. The results showed a significant improvement in localizing PD for major types of PD compared to currently available techniques, such as orthogonal transforms and the calibration line method.","10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2339274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6866921&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866921","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0885-8977","6866921","Insulators|Partial discharges|Power transformer insulation|Transforms|Vectors|Windings","calibration|fuzzy set theory|maintenance engineering|partial discharge measurement|pattern recognition|power transformer insulation|transfer functions|transformer windings","","1"

The paper concentrates on estimating the values of generator inertias but the proposed methodology is general and can be used to identify other generator parameters such as damping coefficients. The methodology has been tested using a wide range of accuracy in the measured modes of oscillations. The results suggest that the methodology is capable of estimating accurately inertias and replicating the dynamic behavior of the power system.

However, such works have assumed that the bandwidth was fully occupied regardless of the transmission requirements and therefore are only valid for this type of scenario. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for EE-SE tradeoff, namely the resource efficiency (RE) for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular network in which we take into consideration different transmission-bandwidth requirements. We analyse the properties of the proposed RE and prove that it is capable of exploiting the tradeoff between EE and SE by balancing consumption power and occupied bandwidth; hence simultaneously optimizing both EE and SE. We then formulate the generalized RE optimization problem with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) and provide a gradient based optimal power adaptation scheme to solve it. We also provide an upper bound near optimal method to jointly solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm based on a uniform power allocation scheme is proposed to reduce the complexity.

Through minimizing a cost functional that penalizes large angles, images with parallel level sets can be obtained. After formally introducing this idea and the corresponding cost functionals, we discuss their Ga&#x0302;teaux derivatives that lead to a diffusion-like gradient descent scheme. We illustrate the properties of this cost functional by several examples in denoising and demosaicking of RGB color images.

In this paper, a new set of LAI products (MERSI GLOBCARBON LAI) has been developed based on the GLOBCARBON LAI algorithm and one year of FY-3A/MERSI land surface reflectance data. MERSI GLOBCARBON LAI has been inter-compared and validated over mainland China against MODIS land surface reflectance (LSR) derived LAI (using the same algorithm) and field LAI measurements. MERSI GLOBCARBON LAI and MODIS GLOBCARBON LAI show continuous and smooth LAI distributions at the start and end of the growing season. For most areas in China, the two LAI products agree well. The temporal variation in MERSI GLOBCARBON LAI and MODIS GLOBCARBON LAI consistently follows the growing season. The largest LAI difference occurs during July, when MERSI shows a much higher frequency of retrievals than does MODIS. Through validation of LAI retrievals with field measurements, our study demonstrates that LAI derived from MERSI and MODIS land surface reflectance products have comparable accuracy. MODIS top-of-atmosphere simple ratio (MODIS TOA SR) is related to MERSI TOA SR with linear correlation coefficients greater than 0.6. After atmospheric correction, the correlation coefficient increases from 0.69 to 0.75 over cropland and from 0.82 to 0.93 over grassland. However, atmospheric correction can still give rise to substantial differences in the reflectance data between the two sensors. Furthermore, different land cover types and different terrain relief have contrasting influences on the atmospheric correction, and these influences reduce the agreement between the two LAI products. This study shows the great potential of FY-3A/MERSI data for global LAI retrieval.","10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2280466","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6616017&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616017","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1939-1404","6616017","Earth|Indexes|Land surface|MODIS|Remote sensing|Satellites|Surface topography","geophysical techniques|remote sensing|vegetation","","1"

In view of this challenge, a clustering-based collaborative filtering approach is proposed in this paper, which aims at recruiting similar services in the same clusters to recommend services collaboratively. Technically, this approach is enacted around two stages. In the first stage, the available services are divided into small-scale clusters, in logic, for further processing. At the second stage, a collaborative filtering algorithm is imposed on one of the clusters. Since the number of the services in a cluster is much less than the total number of the services available on the web, it is expected to reduce the online execution time of collaborative filtering.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that this oscillation frequency can be made nearly insensitive to small-signal fluctuations of these two parameters at certain operating points [1]. Here, we demonstrate that this insensitivity arises from multiwave mixing and interference that minimizes the response of both the gain medium and the circulating optical power at the oscillation frequency. Both experimental measurements and model calculations of optical spectra show that at the operating points of reduced oscillation frequency sensitivity, all strong components of the optical spectrum still exhibit a response to the perturbations. However, in the power spectra and the (calculated) carrier-density spectra, the response is strongly attenuated. Novel operating points that limit the sensitivity of the laser power oscillation frequency to perturbations offer the promise for improved operation of tunable photonic oscillators for radio- and microwave-frequency applications.","10.1109/JLT.2014.2332415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6841598&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6841598","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0733-8724","6841598","Optical attenuators|Optical mixing|Optical polarization|Oscillators|Power lasers|Resonant frequency|Semiconductor lasers","laser tuning|light interference|multiwave mixing|oscillations|semiconductor lasers","","1"

Our techniques are implemented in KLEE-CL, a tool based on the symbolic execution engine KLEE that supports symbolic reasoning on the equivalence between expressions involving both integer and floating-point operations. While the current generation of constraint solvers provide effective support for integer arithmetic, the situation is different for floating-point arithmetic, due to the complexity inherent in such computations. The key insight behind our approach is that floating-point values are only reliably equal if they are essentially built by the same operations. This allows us to use an algorithm based on symbolic expression matching augmented with canonicalisation rules to determine path equivalence. Under symbolic execution, we have to verify equivalence along every feasible control-flow path. We reduce the branching factor of this process by aggressively merging conditionals, if-converting branches into select operations via an aggressive phi-node folding transformation. To support the Intel Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) instruction set, we lower SSE instructions to equivalent generic vector operations, which in turn are interpreted in terms of primitive integer and floating-point operations. To support OpenCL programs, we symbolically model the OpenCL environment using an OpenCL runtime library targeted to symbolic execution. We detect data races by keeping track of all memory accesses using a memory log, and reporting a race whenever we detect that two accesses conflict. By representing the memory log symbolically, we are also able to detect races associated with symbolically-indexed accesses of memory objects. We used KLEE-CL to prove the bounded equivalence between scalar and data-parallel versions of floating-point programs and find a number - f issues in a variety of open source projects that use SSE and OpenCL, including mismatches between implementations, memory errors, race conditions and a compiler bug.","10.1109/TSE.2013.2297120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6698391&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698391","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0098-5589","6698391","Computational modeling|Computer architecture|Kernel|Parallel processing|Programming|Semantics|Vectors","data handling|floating point arithmetic|parallel processing|program debugging","","1"

In particular, we present investigations carried out since 2011 by our multidisciplinary research group, in collaboration with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva. Our research has been first focused on the development of polyimide-coated fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, and recently, it has been extended to nanoscale metal oxide-coated long-period gratings (LPGs). Experimental tests in the [0-70] %RH range at different temperatures, before and after &#x03B3;-ionizing radiation exposures, have been carried out to assess the sensors' performances in conditions required in experiments running at CERN. The advantages and disadvantages of the two proposed technologies are discussed in this paper in light of their possible application in high-energy physics environments. In particular, reported results suggest that LPG-based sensors can be preferred in some applications (particularly in presence of very low humidity levels) mainly because they are able to provide very high RH sensitivity (up to 1.4 nm/% RH), which is up to three orders of magnitude higher than that exhibited by FBG-based hygrometers. On the other side, compared with FBGs, LPGs are more difficult to multiplex due to limitations in terms of available bandwidth.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2357433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6909002&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909002","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6909002","Bragg gratings|Fiber gratings|Humidity|Monitoring|Optical fiber sensors|Titanium compounds","Bragg gratings|antireflection coatings|fibre optic sensors|humidity measurement|hygrometers|optical polymers","","1"

We propose several different energy data terms, the appropriate choice of which allows us to process images with different noise and geometry properties. The contribution of this paper is the design of a flexible and robust elongated CLS extraction framework that is comparatively fast due to the use of a fixed-grid configuration and fast deterministic Radon-based line detector. We present several different applications of the developed approach, namely: 1) CLS extraction in mammographic images; 2) road networks extraction from optical remotely sensed images; and 3) line extraction from palmprint images.

This architecture has been shown to not be fast enough for patients with high or irregular heart rates. Furthermore, both X-ray beams and detectors of the current architecture are made wide enough, so that the entire object is covered in the lateral direction without data truncation. Although novel acquisition protocols have recently been developed to reduce a radiation exposure, the high radiation dose from CT imaging remains a heightened public concern (especially for cardiac CT). The current CT architecture is a major bottleneck to further increase the temporal resolution and reduce the radiation dose. To overcome these problems, we present an innovative stationary-sources rotating-detectors CT (SSRD-CT) architecture based on the three stationary distributed X-ray sources and three smaller rotating X-ray detectors. Each distributed X-ray source has ~ 100 distinctive X-ray focal spots, and each detector has a narrower width compared with the conventional CT detectors. The SSRD-CT will have a field-of-view of 200 mm in diameter at isocenter, which is large enough to image many internal organs, including hearts. X-rays from the distributed sources are activated electronically to simulate the mechanical spinning of conventional single-beam X-ray sources with a high speed. The activation of individual X-ray beam will be synchronized to the corresponding rotating detector at the opposite end. Three source-detector chains can work in parallel to acquire three projections simultaneously and improve temporal resolution. Lower full-body radiation dose is expected for the proposed SSRD-CT because X-rays are restricted to irradiate a local smaller region. Taken together, the proposed SSRD-CT architecture will enable &#x2264;50-ms temporal resolution and reduce radiation dose significantly.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2363367","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928482&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928482","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6928482","Biomedical imaging|Computed tomography|Computer architecture|Detectors|Electron tubes|Heart rate|Image resolution|Radiation monitoring|X-ray detectors|X-ray imaging","X-ray tubes|biomedical equipment|cardiology|computerised tomography|dosimetry|image resolution|medical image processing","","1"

Under the assumption of azimuthal symmetry, when the linear depolarization ratio (LDR) and circular depolarization ratio (CDR) modes are compared, it is found that for most atmospheric scatterers reflectivity is comparable, whereas the depolarization ratio dynamic range is maximized at CDR mode by at least 3 dB. In the presence of anisotropic (aligned) scatterers, that is, when azimuthal symmetry is broken, polarimetric variables at CDR mode do have the desirable property of rotational invariance and, further, the dynamic range of CDR can be significantly larger than the dynamic range of LDR. The physical meaning of the cross-polar coherence is revisited in terms of scattering symmetries, that is, departure from reflection symmetry for the LDR mode and departure from rotation symmetry for the CDR mode. The Simultaneous Transmission and Simultaneous Reception mode (STSR mode or hybrid mode or ZDR mode) is also theoretically analyzed for the case of zenith/nadir pointing radars and, under the assumption of azimuthal symmetry, relations are given to compare measurements obtained at hybrid mode with measurements obtained from orthogonal (LDR and CDR) modes.","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2243155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6472767&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6472767","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0196-2892","6472767","Coherence|Correlation|Covariance matrix|Polarization|Radar antennas|Radar polarimetry","atmospheric techniques|meteorological radar|millimetre wave radar|radar polarimetry|reflectivity","","1"

The system was validated in the following two stages: 1) preclinical to determine function and validate accuracy; and 2) in the clinical setting to assess clinical workflow feasibility and determine overall system accuracy. In the preclinical phase, the system was assessed using both phantom and porcine experimental studies. Median 2-D projection errors of 4.5 and 3.3 mm were found for the phantom and porcine studies, respectively. The clinical phase focused on extending the use of the system to interventions in patients undergoing either atrial fibrillation catheter ablation (CA) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Eleven patients were studied with nine in the CA group and two in the TAVI group. Successful real-time view synchronization was achieved in all cases with a calculated median distance error of 2.2 mm in the CA group and 3.4 mm in the TAVI group. A standard clinical workflow was established using the image fusion system.

Conventional methods, which in the majority of cases focus only on scattering in two dimensions, often suffer from long simulation times or reduced accuracy, neglecting phenomena such as multiple scattering and surface self-shadowing. A simulation based on the scalar wave distributed point source method (DPSM) is presented as an alternative which is computationally more efficient than fully meshed numerical methods while obtaining greater accuracy than approximate analytical techniques. Comparison is made to simulated results obtained using the finite element method for a sinusoidally periodic surface where scattering only occurs in two dimensions, showing very good agreement (&lt;;0.2 dB). In addition to twodimensional scattering, comparison to experimental results is also carried out for scattering in three dimensions when the surface has a Gaussian roughness distribution. Results indicate that for two-dimensional scattering and for rough surfaces with a correlation length equal to the incident wavelength (&#x03BB;) and a root mean square height less than 0.2&#x03BB;, the scalar wave approximation predicts reflected pulse shape change and envelope amplitudes generally to within 1 dB.

Two second-order sliding-mode controllers are evaluated against a feedforward controller combined with either a conventional or an adaptive proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Furthermore, the potential performance and robustness benefits arising from the integration of a body sideslip controller with the yaw rate feedback control system are assessed. The results show that all the evaluated controllers are able to significantly change the understeer behavior with respect to the baseline vehicle. The PID-based controllers achieve very good vehicle performance in steady-state and transient conditions, whereas the controllers based on the sliding-mode approach demonstrate a high level of robustness against variations in the vehicle parameters.

The goals of this paper are to: 1) determine the impact of process-level information on machine learning prediction results and 2) establish the effect of type of machine learning algorithm used on prediction results. Data were collected from a university level course in human factors engineering (n=35), which included both traditional classroom assessment and computer-based assessment methods.

The overall prediction accuracy as well as the chronological progression of prediction accuracy was analyzed for each algorithm. Simple machine learning algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression) had comparable performance with more complex methods (support vector machines, artificial neural networks). Process-level information was not useful in post-hoc predictions, but contributed significantly to allowing for accurate predictions to be made earlier in the course. Process level information provides useful prediction features for development of targeted intervention techniques, as it allows more accurate predictions to be made earlier in the course.

The coupling graph model is sufficiently powerful to capture strong and inherent associations between subgraph pairs in complicated applications. The focus of this paper is on mining algorithms of frequent coupling subgraphs and bioinformatics application. Although existing frequent subgraph mining algorithms are competent to identify frequent subgraphs from a graph database, they perform poorly on frequent coupling subgraph mining because they generate many irrelevant subgraphs. We propose a novel graph transformation technique to transform a coupling graph into a generic graph. Based on the transformed coupling graphs, existing graph mining methods are then utilized to discover frequent coupling subgraphs. We prove that the transformation is precise and complete and that the restoration is reversible. Experiments carried out on a database containing 10,511 coupling graphs show that our proposed algorithm reduces the mining time very much in comparison with the existing subgraph mining algorithms.

Most of the image reconstruction algorithms, developed for this purpose, solve a nonsmooth convex optimization problem involving the image total variation (TV). The TV seminorm is the &#x2113;<sub>1</sub> norm of the image gradient magnitude, and reducing the &#x2113;<sub>1</sub> norm is known to encourage sparsity in its argument. Recently, there has been interest in employing nonconvex lp quasinorms with for sparsity exploiting image reconstruction, which is potentially more effective than &#x2113;<sub>1</sub> because nonconvex lp is closer to &#x2113;<sub>0</sub>-a direct measure of sparsity. This paper develops algorithms for constrained minimization of the total p-variation (TpV), lp of the image gradient. Use of the algorithms is illustrated in the context of breast CT-an imaging modality that is still in the research phase and for which constraints on X-ray dose are extremely tight. The TpV-based image reconstruction algorithms are demonstrated on computer simulated data for exploiting gradient magnitude sparsity to reduce the projection view angle sampling. The proposed algorithms are applied to projection data from a realistic breast CT simulation, where the total X-ray dose is equivalent to two-view digital mammography. Following the simulation survey, the algorithms are then demonstrated on a clinical breast CT data set.","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2300862","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6714374&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6714374","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2372","6714374","Computed tomography|Image reconstruction|Minimization|Optimization|Sparsity|X-ray detection","computerised tomography|diagnostic radiography|image reconstruction|image sampling|mammography|medical image processing|minimisation","","1"

For reliable quality predictions, these objective quality measures need to respond consistently with the behavior of the human visual system (HVS). In practice, many important HVS mechanisms are too complex to be modeled directly. Instead, they can be mimicked by machine learning systems, trained on subjective quality assessment databases, and applied on predefined objective quality measures for specific content or distortion classes. On the downside, machine learning systems are often difficult to interpret and may even contradict the input objective quality measures, leading to unreliable quality predictions. To address this problem, we developed an interpretable machine learning system for objective quality assessment, namely the locally adaptive fusion (LAF). This paper describes the LAF system and compares its performance with traditional machine learning. As it turns out, the LAF system is more consistent with the input measures and can better handle heteroscedastic training data.","10.1109/TIP.2014.2316379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6786302&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786302","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1057-7149","6786302","Accuracy|Databases|Distortion|Distortion measurement|Quality assessment|Standards|Transform coding","image processing|learning (artificial intelligence)|visual perception","","1"

The use of these pose (orientation and position) estimation methods improves the reliability and accuracy of pose measurements. Finally, an extended KF is used to estimate the kinematic parameter errors. The primary advantage of this method over existing automated self-calibration methods is that it does not involve complex steps, such as camera calibration, corner detection, and laser alignment, which makes the proposed robot calibration procedure more autonomous in a dynamic manufacturing environment.

This type of link can consist of single nodes with a large number of antennas or a large number of cooperating nodes-each contributing a small number of antennas. Such massive systems naturally lead to link topologies that are not often considered in studies of smaller scale cooperative MIMO scenarios. For this system to be economically practical, each node participating in the massive link likely has limited transmit power capability, and therefore properly limiting the per-node transmit power must be incorporated into the signal processing algorithm. This paper develops a generalized multiuser massive MIMO (G4M) optimization algorithm for colocated or cooperative signaling, subject to any sum-, per-antenna, or per-node power constraint, and that can also accommodate nonlinear precoding and detection and any number of antennas.

Our method takes as first step the extraction of the retina vascular tree using the graph cut technique. The blood vessel information is then used to estimate the location of the optic disk. The optic disk segmentation is performed using two alternative methods. The Markov random field (MRF) image reconstruction method segments the optic disk by removing vessels from the optic disk region, and the compensation factor method segments the optic disk using the prior local intensity knowledge of the vessels.

We have recently proposed a method, named persistent scatterer pair (PSP), aimed at overcoming some limitations of standard techniques. The PSP method is characterized by the fact of exploiting only the relative properties of neighboring pairs of points for both detection and analysis of persistent scatterers (PSs), intended in the general sense of scatterers that exhibit interferometric coherence for the time period and baseline span of the acquisitions, including both point-like and distributed scatterers. Thanks to the pair-of-point approach, the PSP technique is intrinsically not affected by artifacts slowly variable in space, like those depending on atmosphere or orbits. Moreover, by exploiting a very redundant set of pair-of-point connections, the PSP approach guarantees extremely dense and accurate displacement and elevation measurements, both in correspondence of structures and when the backscattering is weak or distributed as in the case of natural terrains. In all cases, the measurements keep the full resolution of the input SAR images. In this work, the qualifying characteristics of the PSP technique are described, and several application examples and validation tests based on COSMO-SkyMed data are reported, which demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2343915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6881816&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881816","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1939-1404","6881816","Atmospheric measurements|Coherence|Displacement measurement|Extraterrestrial measurements|Interferometry|Synthetic aperture radar|Terrain factors","backscatter|displacement measurement|environmental monitoring (geophysics)|geomorphology|radar interferometry|remote sensing by radar|synthetic aperture radar|terrain mapping","","1"

To propel in an energy efficient manner, wheelchair users must learn to control bimanually applied forces onto the rims, preserving both speed and direction of locomotion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate mechanical efficiency and propulsion technique during the initial stage of motor learning. Therefore, 70 naive able-bodied men received 12-min uninstructed wheelchair practice, consisting of three 4-min blocks separated by 2 min rest. Practice was performed on a motor-driven treadmill at a fixed belt speed and constant power output relative to body mass. Energy consumption and the kinetics of propulsion technique were continuously measured. Participants significantly increased their mechanical efficiency and changed their propulsion technique from a high frequency mode with a lot of negative work to a longer-slower movement pattern with less power losses. Furthermore a multi-level model showed propulsion technique to relate to mechanical efficiency. Finally improvers and non-improvers were identified. The non-improving group was already more efficient and had a better propulsion technique in the first block of practice (i.e., the fourth minute). These findings link propulsion technique to mechanical efficiency, support the importance of a correct propulsion technique for wheelchair users and show motor learning differences.","10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2280301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6626622&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6626622","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1534-4320","6626622","Atmospheric measurements|Educational institutions|Particle measurements|Propulsion|Torque|Wheelchairs|Wheels","force control|gait analysis|handicapped aids|patient rehabilitation|power consumption|wheelchairs","","1"

In this way, the properties of two songs used to model their mashability can be altered with respect to transformations performed to maximize their perceptual compatibility. AutoMashUpper has a user interface to allow users to control the parameterization of the mashability estimation.

This avoids additional preparations, such as physical sensor attachment or special clothing, which can be useful for certain healthcare applications. Furthermore, robustness of Doppler radar against environmental factors, such as light, ambient temperature, interference from other signals occupying the same bandwidth, fading effects, reduce environmental constraints and strengthens the possibility of employing Doppler radar in long-term respiration detection, and monitoring applications such as sleep studies. This paper presents an evaluation in the of use of microwave Doppler radar for capturing different dynamics of breathing patterns in addition to the respiration rate. Although finding the respiration rate is essential, identifying abnormal breathing patterns in real-time could be used to gain further insights into respiratory disorders and refine diagnostic procedures. Several known breathing disorders were professionally role played and captured in a real-time laboratory environment using a noncontact Doppler radar to evaluate the feasibility of this noncontact form of measurement in capturing breathing patterns under different conditions associated with certain breathing disorders. In addition to that, inhalation and exhalation flow patterns under different breathing scenarios were investigated to further support the feasibility of Doppler radar to accurately estimate the tidal volume. The results obtained for both experiments were compared with the gold standard measurement schemes, such as respiration belt and spirometry readings, yielding significant correlations with the Doppler radar-based information. In summary, Doppler radar is highlighted as an alternative approach not only for determining respiration rates, but also for identifying breathing patterns and tidal volumes as a preferred nonwearable alternative to the conventional - ontact sensing methods.","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2365776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6942141&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6942141","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2372","6942141","Belts|Continuous wavelet transforms|Doppler radar|Sleep apnea|Time-frequency analysis","Doppler radar|electromagnetic interference|health care|medical disorders|medical signal detection|microwave measurement|patient diagnosis|patient monitoring|pneumodynamics|sleep","","1"

By low biasing the Mach-Zehnder modulator, linearization can be achieved through simply multiplying the distorted signal by the coreceived low-pass band. Theory analysis shows that only the bias angle should be known by the algorithm, whereas the simulation shows adequate tolerance. The low bias angle also results in an improved link gain. The experiment shows a well-suppressed third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3).

We found that the sensitivity of a refractometer is linearly proportional to the wavelength of the dip/peak in the transmission spectrum that is chosen to measure the refractive index (RI) change. Because the wavelength shift is larger for a dip/peak at a longer wavelength than at a shorter wavelength, a linear spectral chirp will occur in the transmission spectrum when the surrounding RI changes. We also found that the sensitivity significantly increases with the decrease in the diameter of the NCF and is independent of its length.

A new method for testing the optical Kerr-effect induced bias error in the RMOG is proposed and demonstrated. A square-wave intensity-modulated optical signal with a symmetrical duty ratio of 50% is achieved by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM), thus making the input-intensity mismatch between the CW and CCW lightwaves change periodically. In this way, we obtain the optical Kerr-effect induced bias errors that vary periodically in accordance with the variation of the square-wave signal. The experimental results show a good agreement with the theoretical value. Moreover, the testing result of the closed-loop RMOG is consistent with the open-loop one.

This was achieved by constructing a spatial composite indicator of cumulative climate change impact, which integrates four climate- and hazard-related subindicators: seasonal temperature trends, seasonal precipitation trends, drought occurrences, and major flood events. The analysis is based on time-series of freely available continuous, gridded geo-spatial datasets, including remote sensing data.

This is achieved through a rigorous account of left quaternion Hilbert spaces, which makes it possible to generalise standard RKHS to quaternion RKHS. Quaternion versions of the Riesz representation and Moore-Aronszajn theorems are next introduced, thus underpinning kernel estimation algorithms operating on quaternion-valued feature spaces.

Previous studies mainly focus on time division duplexing (TDD) systems, which are more amenable to practical implementations due to channel reciprocity. However, there are many frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems deployed worldwide. Consequently, it is of great importance to investigate the design and performance of FDD massive MIMO systems. To reduce the overhead of channel estimation in FDD systems, a two-stage precoding scheme was recently proposed to decompose the precoding procedure into intergroup precoding and intragroup precoding. The problem of user grouping and scheduling thus arises. In this paper, we first propose three novel similarity measures for user grouping based on weighted likelihood, subspace projection, and Fubini-Study, respectively, as well as two novel clustering methods, including hierarchical and K-medoids clustering. We then propose a dynamic user scheduling scheme to further enhance the system throughput once the user groups are formed. The load balancing problem is considered when few users are active and solved with an effective algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed schemes are validated with theoretical analysis and simulations.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2353297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6888467&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888467","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6888467","Channel estimation|Clustering methods|Costs|Design methodology|Dynamic scheduling|Finite difference methods|Frequency conversion|MIMO|Throughtput|Time division multiplexing|Weight measurement","MIMO communication|channel estimation|dynamic scheduling|frequency division multiplexing|group theory|pattern clustering|precoding|resource allocation","","1"

To address this issue, this paper investigates an energy-efficient approach to supplementing an 802.15.4-based wireless sensor network with high bandwidth, high power, longer range radios, such as 802.11. Exploiting a key observation that the high-bandwidth radio achieves low energy consumption per bit of transmitted data due to its inherent transmission efficiency, we propose a hybrid network architecture that utilizes an optimal density of dual-radio (802.15.4 and 802.11) nodes to augment a sensor network having only 802.15.4 radios. We present a cross-layer mathematical model to calculate this optimal density, which strikes a delicate balance between the low energy consumption per transmitted bit of the high-bandwidth radio and low sleep power of the 802.15.4.

One of the key components of this robot is the ability to modify its dance motions with varying tempos, without exceeding motor limitations, in the same way that human dancers modify their motions. In this paper, we first observe human performances with varying musical tempos of the same musical piece, and then analyze human modification strategies. The analysis is conducted in terms of three body components: lower, middle, and upper bodies. We assume that these body components have different purposes and different modification strategies, respectively, for the performance of a dance. For all of the motions of these three components, we have found that certain fixed postures, which we call keyposes, tend to be preserved. Thus, this paper presents a method to create motions for robots at a certain music tempo, from human motion at an original music tempo, by using these keyposes. We have implemented these algorithms as an automatic process and validated their effectiveness by using a physical humanoid robot HRP-2. This robot succeeded in performing the Aizu-bandaisan dance, one of the Japanese traditional folk dances, 1.2 and 1.5 times faster than the tempo originally learned, while maintaining its physical constraints.

For this reason, this paper develops a seamless fusion between LiDAR and aerial imagery on the basis of aspect graphs, which utilize the features of houses, such as geometry, structures, and shapes. First, 3-D primitives, standing for houses, are chosen, and their projections are represented by the aspects. A hierarchical aspect graph is then constructed using aerial image processing in combination with the results of LiDAR data processing. In the aspect graph, the note represents the face aspect and the arc is described by attributes obtained by the formulated coding regulations, and the coregistration between the aspect and LiDAR data is implemented. As a consequence, the aspects and/or the aspect graph are interpreted for the extraction of houses, and then the houses are fitted using a planar equation for creating a digital building model (DBM). The experimental field, which is located in Wytheville, VA, is used to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of effectively extracting houses at a successful rate of 93%, as compared with another method, which is 82% effective when LiDAR spacing is approximately 7.3 by 7.3 ft<sup>2</sup>.

The attainable routing depends on a delicate balance of diverse and often conflicting quality-of-service requirements. Finding the optimal solution typically becomes an nonolynomial-hard problem, as the network size increases in terms of the number of nodes. Moreover, the employment of user-defined utility functions for the aggregation of the different objective functions often leads to suboptimal solutions. On the other hand, Pareto optimality is capable of amalgamating the different design objectives by providing an element of elitism. Although there is a plethora of bioinspired algorithms that attempt to address this optimization problem, they often fail to generate all the points constituting the optimal Pareto front. As a remedy, we propose an optimal multiobjective quantum-assisted algorithm, namely the nondominated quantum optimization algorithm (NDQO), which evaluates the legitimate routes using the concept of Pareto optimality at a reduced complexity. We then compare the performance of the NDQO algorithm to the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating that the NDQO algorithm achieves a near-optimal performance. Furthermore, we analytically derive the upper and lower bounds of the NDQO algorithmic complexity, which is of the order of O(N) and O(N&#x221A;(N)) in the best and worst case scenario, respectively. This corresponds to a substantial complexity reduction of the NDQO from the order of O(N<sup>2</sup>) imposed by the brute-force method.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2327596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6825798&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6825798","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6825798","Biological system modeling|Complexity theory|Optimization|Quality of service|Quantum computing|Routing|Self-organizing networks|Wireless sensor networks","Pareto optimisation|quality of service|quantum computing|telecommunication network routing|wireless sensor networks","","1"

The mmW bands offer orders of magnitude greater spectrum than current cellular allocations and enable very high-dimensional antenna arrays for further gains via beamforming and spatial multiplexing. This paper uses recent real-world measurements at 28 and 73 GHz in New York, NY, USA, to derive detailed spatial statistical models of the channels and uses these models to provide a realistic assessment of mmW micro- and picocellular networks in a dense urban deployment. Statistical models are derived for key channel parameters, including the path loss, number of spatial clusters, angular dispersion, and outage. It is found that, even in highly non-line-of-sight environments, strong signals can be detected 100-200 m from potential cell sites, potentially with multiple clusters to support spatial multiplexing. Moreover, a system simulation based on the models predicts that mmW systems can offer an order of magnitude increase in capacity over current state-of-the-art 4G cellular networks with no increase in cell density from current urban deployments.","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2328154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6834753&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6834753","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0733-8716","6834753","Antenna measurements|Clustering algorithms|Delays|Gain|Mobile communication|Power measurement|Standards","4G mobile communication|array signal processing|microcellular radio|microwave antenna arrays|millimetre wave antenna arrays|next generation networks|picocellular radio|radio spectrum management|signal detection|space division multiplexing|statistical analysis|submillimetre wave antennas|wireless channels","","1"

At the same time, the statistical methodology for microarray analysis has progressed from simple visual assessments of results to novel algorithms for analyzing changes in expression profiles. In a micro-RNA (miRNA) or gene-expression profiling experiment, the expression levels of thousands of genes/miRNAs are simultaneously monitored to study the effects of certain treatments, diseases, and developmental stages on their expressions. Microarray-based gene expression profiling can be used to identify genes, whose expressions are changed in response to pathogens or other organisms by comparing gene expression in infected to that in uninfected cells or tissues. Recent studies have revealed that patterns of altered microarray expression profiles in cancer can serve as molecular biomarkers for tumor diagnosis, prognosis of disease-specific outcomes, and prediction of therapeutic responses. Microarray data sets containing expression profiles of a number of miRNAs or genes are used to identify biomarkers, which have dysregulation in normal and malignant tissues. However, small sample size remains a bottleneck to design successful classification methods. On the other hand, adequate number of microarray data that do not have clinical knowledge can be employed as additional source of information. In this paper, a combination of kernelized fuzzy rough set (KFRS) and semisupervised support vector machine (S<sup>3</sup>VM) is proposed for predicting cancer biomarkers from one miRNA and three gene expression data sets. Biomarkers are discovered employing three feature selection methods, including KFRS. The effectiveness of the proposed KFRS and S<sup>3</sup>VM combination on the microarray data sets is demonstrated, and the cancer biomarkers identified from miRNA data are reported. Furthermore, biological significance tests are conducted for miRNA cancer biomarkers.","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2375820","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6971078&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6971078","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2372","6971078","Biomarkers|Cancer|Gene expression|Kernel|Support vector machines|Training|Tumors","RNA|biomedical equipment|cancer|diseases|feature selection|fuzzy set theory|genetics|lab-on-a-chip|learning (artificial intelligence)|medical diagnostic computing|molecular biophysics|patient diagnosis|patient monitoring|patient treatment|pattern classification|statistical analysis|support vector machines|tumours","","1"

These incidents are often diagnosed as no fault found. Investigators, who follow the line of diagnostic reasoning from the 1989 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) SA report, tend to conclude that SAs are caused by driver pedal error. This paper reviews the diagnostic process in the NHTSA report and finds that: 1) it assumes that an intermittent electronic malfunction should be reproducible either through in-vehicle or laboratory bench tests without saying why and 2) the consequence of this assumption, for which there appears to be no forensic precedent, is to recategorize possible intermittent electronic failures as proven to be nonelectronic. Showing that the supposedly inescapable conclusions of the NHTSA report concerning electronic malfunctions are without foundation opens the way for this paper to discuss electronic intermittency as a potential factor in SA incidents. It then reports a simple practical experiment that shows how mechanically induced electrical contact intermittencies can generate false speed signals that an automobile speed control system may accept as true and that do not trigger any diagnostic fault codes. Since the generation of accurate speed signals is essential for the proper functioning of a number of other automobile safety-critical control systems, the apparent ease with which false speed signals can be generated by vibration of a poor electrical contact is obviously a matter of general concern. Various ways of reducing the likelihood of SAs are discussed, including electrical contact improvements to reduce the likelihood of generating false speed signals, improved battery maintenance, and the incorporation of an independent fail-safe that reduces engine power in an emergency, such as a kill switch.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2313296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777269&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6777269","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6777269","Acceleration|Automotive electronics|Electric contact resistance|Engines|Fault diagnosis|Velocity control","automobiles|automotive electronics|electrical contacts|road safety|velocimeters|velocity control","","1"

The effort and time required to ramp-up a system is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the human decision making process to select the most promising sequence of actions to improve the system to the required level of performance. Although existing work has identified significant factors influencing the effectiveness of ramp-up, little has been done to support the decision making during the process. This paper approaches ramp-up as a sequential adjustment and tuning process that aims to get a manufacturing system to a desirable performance in the fastest possible time. Production stations and machines are the key resources in a manufacturing system. They are often functionally decoupled and can be treated in the first instance as independent ramp-up problems. Hence, this paper focuses on developing a Markov decision process (MDP) model to formalize ramp-up of production stations and enable their formal analysis. The aim is to capture the cause-and-effect relationships between an operator's adaptation or adjustment of a station and the station's response to improve the effectiveness of the process. Reinforcement learning has been identified as a promising approach to learn from ramp-up experience and discover more successful decision-making policies. Batch learning in particular can perform well with little data. This paper investigates the application of a Q-batch learning algorithm combined with an MDP model of the ramp-up process. The approach has been applied to a highly automated production station where several ramp-up processes are carried out. The convergence of the Q-learning algorithm has been analyzed along with the variation of its parameters. Finally, the learned policy has been applied and compared against previous ramp-up cases.","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2294155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702489&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6702489","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2216","6702489","Algorithm design and analysis|Decision making|Learning (artificial intelligence)|Manufacturing systems|Personnel","Markov processes|decision making|learning (artificial intelligence)|manufacturing systems|production engineering computing","","1"

From these analyses, the vector control methods of the torque, speed, the dc-link voltage of the isolated inverter, and the grid power factor are proposed. Since the power supplied from the single-phase grid is pulsating and the machine is directly connected to the grid, the controlled torque and power inevitably pulsates at twice the grid frequency.

As modern microprocessor chips are characterized by very dense, billion-transistor designs, such attacks must be very carefully crafted. In this paper, we demonstrate zero overhead malicious modifications on both high-performance and embedded microprocessors. These hardware trojans enable privilege escalation through execution of an instruction stream that excites the necessary conditions to make the modification appear. The minimal footprint, however, comes at the cost of a small window of attack opportunities.

This model represents the dynamics of the formation as a whole as a function of the dynamics of the member robots. Given this model, generalized cluster space forces can be applied to the formation, and a Jacobian transpose controller can be implemented to transform cluster space compensation forces into robot-level forces to be applied to the robots in the formation. Then, a nonlinear model-based partition controller is proposed. This controller cancels out the formation dynamics and effectively decouples the cluster space variables.

In Part I, we analyze the TO optimization problem in the presence of channel allocation (CA), i.e., joint CA and the TO optimization problem from a game theoretic perspective, and prove that the joint optimization problem can be formulated as an exact potential game, which has at least one &#x201C;pure strategy Nash Equilibrium&#x201D; for any subset of the complete CA-TO action set and for any initial CA and TO conditions. We also show that the proposed joint CA and TO game is equal to the max-cut of a novel TO-dependent holistic system interference graph. In Part II, we present novel joint CA-TO algorithms and their performance analysis in D2D communications underlays.","10.1109/TWC.2014.2314633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6783803&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6783803","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1536-1276","6783803","Games|Indexes|Interference|Joints|Optimization|Signal to noise ratio|Wireless communication","cellular radio|channel allocation|game theory|graph theory|minimisation|radio transmitters|radiofrequency interference","","1"

We observed dramatically cavity-enhanced absorption, hot photoluminescence emission, and Raman scattering of the monolayer graphene. We also described a broad-spectrum enhancement of the light-matter interaction by coupling graphene with a bus waveguide on a silicon-on-insulator photonic integrated circuit, which enables a 6.2-dB transmission attenuation due to the graphene absorption over a waveguide length of 70 &#x03BC;m. By electrically gating the graphene monolayer coupled with a planar photonic crystal nanocavity, electrooptic modulation of the cavity reflection was possible with a contrast in excess of 10 dB. Moreover, a novel modulator device based on the cavity-coupled graphene-boron nitride-graphene capacitor was fabricated, showing a modulation speed up to 0.57 GHz. These results indicate the applications of graphene-cavity devices in high-speed and high-contrast modulators with low energy consumption.

The optimal linear coefficients are selected to generate the LNCC, aiming to: 1) maximize the sum-rate in the MAC phase; and 2) ensure unambiguous decoding. To avoid the performance degradation caused by high-order irregular mappings, properly designed source coding is used for compressing the LNCC alphabet over the hybrid finite ring into the unifying 4-ary alphabet.

The geometric asymmetry of a tubular microjet leads to the development of a capillary force, which tends to propel a bubble toward the larger opening of the tube. Because of this motion in an asymmetric tube, there emerges a momentum transfer to the fluid. In order to compensate this momentum transfer, a jet force acting on the tube occurs.

It consists of a thin metal conductor symmetrically sandwiched by two-layer dielectrics with low-index nanoscale gaps inside. The SCGD waveguide can support ultra-long range surface plasmon-polariton mode when the thickness of a low-index gap is smaller than a cutoff gap thickness. For relatively high index contrast ratios of the cladding to gap layers, the cutoff gap thickness is only a few nanometers, within which the electric field of the guided SCGD mode is tightly confined. The dispersion equations and approximate analytical expressions of the cutoff gap thickness are derived in order to characterize the properties of the guided mode. Our simulation results show that the cutoff gap thickness can be tailored by the metal film thickness and the indices of the cladding and gap materials.

However, conventional SVF is only able to express the degree of openness of the sky as a ratio, and it is limited to being used as a performance index for the positioning that uses the GNSS. When the conventional SVF is used in a land transportation environment, the predicted value for the positioning performance of the GNSS is often not consistent with the actual positioning error, but when sky-view-based dilution of precision (SVDOP) is applied, we confirmed that it was substantially close to the actual positioning error.

This paper presents a quantitative characterization of multivariable ankle mechanical impedance of young healthy subjects when their muscles were relaxed, to serve as a baseline to compare with pathophysiological ankle properties of biomechanically and/or neurologically impaired patients. Measurements using a highly backdrivable wearable ankle robot combined with multi-input multi-output stochastic system identification methods enabled reliable characterization of ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) simultaneously, the sagittal and frontal planes. The characterization included important ankle properties unavailable from single DOF studies: coupling between DOFs and anisotropy as a function of frequency. Ankle impedance in joint coordinates showed responses largely consistent with a second-order system consisting of inertia, viscosity, and stiffness in both seated (knee flexed) and standing (knee straightened) postures. Stiffness in the sagittal plane was greater than in the frontal plane and furthermore, was greater when standing than when seated, most likely due to the stretch of bi-articular muscles (medial and lateral gastrocnemius). Very low off-diagonal partial coherences implied negligible coupling between dorsiflexion-plantarflexion and inversion-eversion. The directions of principal axes were tilted slightly counterclockwise from the original joint coordinates. The directional variation (anisotropy) of ankle impedance in the 2-D space formed by rotations in the sagittal and frontal planes exhibited a characteristic &#x201C;peanut&#x201D; shape, weak in inversion-eversion over a wide range of frequencies from the stiffness dominated region up to the inertia dominated region.

DC/DC conversion at HV is required for interconnection of such HVdc schemes as well as to interface dc wind farms. Modular multilevel voltage source converters (VSCs), such as the modular multilevel converter (MMC) or the alternate arm converter (AAC), have been shown to incur significantly lower switching losses than previous two- or three-level VSCs. This paper presents a dc/ac/dc system using a transformer coupling two modular multilevel VSCs. In such a system, the capacitors occupy a large fraction of the volume of the cells but a significant reduction in volume can be achieved by raising the ac frequency. Using high frequency can also bring benefits to other passive components such as the transformer but also results in higher switching losses due to the higher number of waveform steps per second. This leads to a tradeoff between volume and losses which has been explored in this study and verified by simulation results with a transistor level model of 30-MW case study. The outcome of the study shows that a frequency of 350 Hz provides a significant improvement in volume but also a penalty in losses compared to 50 Hz.","10.1109/TPEL.2013.2292614","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6675087&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6675087","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0885-8993","6675087","Capacitors|HVDC transmission|Power conversion|Switching loss|Topology|Valves","AC-DC power convertors|DC-AC power convertors|DC-DC power convertors|HVDC power convertors|capacitors|switching convertors|transformers","","1"

The proposed scheme utilizes a priori information about the sparsity rate and noise variance for enhanced recovery. At the same time, the proposed scheme is robust against inaccurate estimates of the clipping signal statistics. The undistorted phase property of the clipped signal, as well as the clipping likelihood, is utilized for enhanced reconstruction. Furthermore, motivated by the nature of modern OFDM-based communication systems, we extend our clipping reconstruction approach to multiple antenna receivers and multi-user OFDM.We also address the problem of channel estimation from pilots contaminated by the clipping distortion.

Furthermore, the sparse representation can be obtained in polynomial time by basis pursuit (BP), when K &lt;; 0.91/&#x03BC;(D). Therefore, there is a gap between the unicity condition and the one required to use the polynomial-complexity BP formulation. For the case of general dictionaries, it is also well known that finding the sparse representation under the only constraint of unicity is NP-hard. In this paper, we introduce, for the case of Fourier and canonical bases, a polynomial complexity algorithm that finds all the possible K-sparse representations of a signal under the weaker condition that K &lt;; &#x221A;2/&#x03BC;(D). Consequently, when K &lt;; 1/&#x03BC;(D), the proposed algorithm solves the unique sparse representation problem for this structured dictionary in polynomial time.

In principle, a cylinder-by-cylinder control approach could compensate for air, residuals, and temperature imbalance. However, in order to fully benefit from closed-loop combustion control, it is necessary to obtain feedback signals from each engine cylinder to reconstruct the pressure trace. Therefore, cylinder imbalance is an issue that can be detected in a laboratory environment, wherein each engine cylinder is instrumented with a dedicated pressure transducer. This paper describes the framework and preliminary results of a model-based estimation approach to predict the individual pressure traces in a multicylinder engine relying on a very restricted sensor set, namely, a crankshaft speed sensor, a single production-grade pressure sensor. The objective of the estimator is to reconstruct the complete pressure trace during an engine cycle with sufficient accuracy to allow for detection of cylinder to cylinder imbalances. Starting from a model of the engine crankshaft dynamics, an adaptive sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the cylinder pressure from the crankshaft speed fluctuation measurement. The results obtained by the estimator are compared with experimental data obtained on a four-cylinder diesel engine.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2358954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6901187&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901187","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6901187","Combustion|Compensation|Engine cylinders|Engines|Pressure control|Sliding mode control|Temperature control|Torque control","adaptive control|closed loop systems|combustion|control system synthesis|diesel engines|observers|pressure transducers|sensors|shafts|torque|variable structure systems|velocity measurement","","1"

Maxwell's equations describing the modal properties of scalar and semivectorial guided waves in the 2-D waveguides are expressed as variational/minimization problems, which are then discretized in terms of a finite-difference scheme on a finite rectangular computational window. By applying a dynamic programming technique to solve such variational problems, a 1-D equation representing the relation between the modal fields on any pair of adjacent columns in the computational window can be derived. By using such 1-D equation in a stepwise fashion from one boundary column toward the other boundary column, a system of linear equations with the unknown column modal fields can be derived and then solved to give both the accurate modal indexes and the discrete modal fields. In the examples of one weakly guiding rib-type dielectric waveguide and another strongly guiding silicon-on-insulator waveguide, computational results show that a small size of the coefficient matrix for such a system of linear equations is adequate to cause a relative error of 10<sup>-5</sup>-10<sup>-6</sup> in the evaluation of the modal indexes reachable in an efficient manner. The results of the convergence tests show that the proposed method is at least an order of magnitude faster than the conventional finite-difference beam propagation method because of the transformation of a 2-D problem into a 1-D problem. Moreover, the proposed method is applied to investigate the modal properties of the conductor-gap-silicon plasmonic waveguide. The feature of the hybrid guided-mode profile is also observable from the modal field calculated by the proposed method.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2353627","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6892923&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892923","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6892923","Dynamic programming|Equations|Mathematical model|Optical waveguides|Permittivity|Slabs|Transmission line matrix methods","dynamic programming|finite difference methods|optical waveguides|rib waveguides|silicon-on-insulator","","1"

Typical online social network applications, such as Facebook and Twitter, are built on top of an infrastructure of servers that provides the services on behalf of the users. For a given communication pattern among users, the loads of the servers depend critically on how the users are assigned to the servers. A good assignment will reduce the overall load of the system while balancing the loads among the servers. Unfortunately, this optimal assignment problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we investigate three heuristic algorithms for solving the user server assignment problem: 1) the centralized simulated annealing (CSA) algorithm; 2) the distributed simulated annealing (DSA) algorithm; and 3) the distributed perturbed greedy search (DPGS). The CSA algorithm produces good solution in the fastest time, however it relies on timely accurate global system information, and is practical only for small and static systems. In contrast, the two distributed algorithms, DSA and DPGS, exploit local information at each server during their search for the optimal assignment, and thus can scale well with the number of users and servers as well as adapting to the system dynamics. Simulation results show that the performance of the distributed algorithms, specifically the DPGS algorithm, is very competitive with that of the centralized algorithm while providing the advantage of naturally adapting to time-varying communication patterns of users.","10.1109/TETC.2014.2358801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6909044&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909044","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-6750","6909044","Approximation algorithms|Distributed algorithms|Distributed databases|Heuristic algorithms|Linear programming|Online services|Operations research|Partitioning algorithms|Simulated annealing|Social network services","client-server systems|computational complexity|search problems|simulated annealing|social networking (online)","","1"

This advancement in mobile networks has forced researchers to explore various methods of energy saving, although with little emphasis on motorway vehicular networks where mobility is also an important aspect. Energy saving in these networks is extremely challenging due to the dynamic nature of the environment in which they operate. To analyze such a network, we first develop a performance model for a medium access control (MAC) protocol, namely, the modified version of packet reservation multiple access (M-PRMA) with wireless channel impairments in a motorway vehicular environment. The M-PRMA protocol provides communication links (time slots) between an AP and the vehicles in range. The time slots of the M-PRMA protocol are modeled as servers where each outage of the channel is represented as a server on queue-length-independent vacation. Then, each AP, in a hierarchical micro-macro topology, is modeled as a single-server queue where the AP takes queue-length-dependent vacations (switches to sleep mode) to save energy during its inactivity period, although at the expense of degraded quality of service (QoS). To address this, a number of sleep strategies for the AP are studied. Finally, both of these proposed models (M-PRMA with channel impairments and AP with sleep cycles) are analyzed and verified through simulations. The performance results reveal that the introduction of sleep strategies at an AP can save up to 80% transmission energy during off-peak hours and 66% on average during the day in a motorway vehicular environment while supporting end-to-end QoS for video and audio conferencing applications.","10.1109/TVT.2013.2289889","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6656956&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6656956","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9545","6656956","Analytical models|Delays|Protocols|Quality of service|Servers|Vehicles|Wireless communication","mobile radio|packet reservation multiple access|power consumption|quality of service|teleconferencing|video communication","",""

These features are derived from across the scientific time-series analysis literature, and include summaries of time series in terms of their correlation structure, distribution, entropy, stationarity, scaling properties, and fits to a range of time-series models. After computing thousands of features for each time series in a training set, those that are most informative of the class structure are selected using greedy forward feature selection with a linear classifier. The resulting feature-based classifiers automatically learn the differences between classes using a reduced number of time-series properties, and circumvent the need to calculate distances between time series. Representing time series in this way results in orders of magnitude of dimensionality reduction, allowing the method to perform well on very large data sets containing long time series or time series of different lengths. For many of the data sets studied, classification performance exceeded that of conventional instance-based classifiers, including one nearest neighbor classifiers using euclidean distances and dynamic time warping and, most importantly, the features selected provide an understanding of the properties of the data set, insight that can guide further scientific investigation.","10.1109/TKDE.2014.2316504","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6786425&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786425","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1041-4347","6786425","Data mining|Databases|Feature extraction|Market research|Time measurement|Time series analysis","data mining|feature extraction|feature selection|greedy algorithms|learning (artificial intelligence)|pattern classification|time series","","1"

However, these methods suffer from pose and illumination variations. In order to address these problems, this paper proposes a novel methodology to recognize the face images. Since image gradients are invariant to illumination and pose variations, the proposed approach uses gradient orientation to handle these effects. The Schur decomposition is used for matrix decomposition and then Schurvalues and Schurvectors are extracted for subspace projection. We call this subspace projection of face features as Schurfaces, which is numerically stable and have the ability of handling defective matrices. The Hausdorff distance is used with the nearest neighbor classifier to measure the similarity between different faces. Experiments are conducted with Yale face database and ORL face database. The results show that the proposed approach is highly discriminant and achieves a promising accuracy for face recognition than the state-of-the-art approaches.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2348018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6878464&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6878464","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6878464","Authentication|Biometrics|Cameras|Computer vision|Face recognition|Pattern recognition|Surveillance","face recognition|feature extraction|gradient methods|image classification|image matching|matrix decomposition|principal component analysis","","1"

However, these images are no longer accurate once the skull has been opened and brain shift occurs. To account for changes in the shape of the brain caused by mechanical (e.g., gravity-induced deformations) and physiological effects (e.g., hyperosmotic drug-induced shrinking, or edema-induced swelling), updated images of the brain must be provided to the neuronavigation system in a timely manner for practical use in the operating room. In this paper, a novel preoperative and intraoperative computational processing pipeline for near real-time brain shift correction in the operating room was developed to automate and simplify the processing steps. Preoperatively, a computer model of the patient's brain with a subsequent atlas of potential deformations due to surgery is generated from diagnostic image volumes. In the case of interim gross changes between diagnosis, and surgery when reimaging is necessary, our preoperative pipeline can be generated within one day of surgery. Intraoperatively, sparse data measuring the cortical brain surface is collected using an optically tracked portable laser range scanner. These data are then used to guide an inverse modeling framework whereby full volumetric brain deformations are reconstructed from precomputed atlas solutions to rapidly match intraoperative cortical surface shift measurements. Once complete, the volumetric displacement field is used to update, i.e., deform, preoperative brain images to their intraoperative shifted state. In this paper, five surgical cases were analyzed with respect to the computational pipeline and workflow timing. With respect to postcortical surface data acquisition, the approximate execution time was 4.5 min. The total update process which included positioning the scanner, data acquisition, inverse model processing, and image deforming was ~ 11-13 min.

In addition, the proposed IQ demodulation algorithm makes signal processing easy to implement and allows fast and real-time demodulation. A proof-of-concept experiment is carried out in an ~1.6-km standard single-mode fiber consisting of two different sections of fibers.

This method is based on the observation that the perceived quality of despeckled SAR images is not always appropriately described by classical statistical and deterministic parameters that are proposed in the literature. Various evaluations are performed here. A preliminary visual qualitative evaluation is taken as a reference for the subsequent quantitative assessment. Then, a revised statistical analysis that can solve some of the drawbacks of previous methods is proposed; however, the statistical approach still has certain drawbacks. To address this problem, a new frequency analysis approach is first proposed, together with a definition of the appropriate indexes. In this way, it is possible to select the best filter in terms of noise reduction, edge and texture preservation, while limiting the effect of introduced distortions. While statistical analysis is widely used in the literature, frequency analysis has never been presented for this aim, especially for non-linear filters. We prove that frequency analysis can robustly identify the best filter, taking perceptual considerations into account, even when statistical analysis fails. Despeckling methods based on anisotropic diffusion algorithms are used for a comparison, but the proposed analysis can be applied to any filtering method. Experiments are presented with SAR images from the Italian Cosmo/Skymed constellation. Both Stripmap and Spotlight acquisitions have been evaluated, and to prove the validity of the proposed method with respect to different spatial resolutions and different classes of interest, various classes are considered.","10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2279501","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595646&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595646","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1939-1404","6595646","Image edge detection|Indexes|Noise|Noise reduction|Quality assessment|Speckle|Synthetic aperture radar","diffusion|image resolution|image texture|nonlinear filters|radar imaging|statistical analysis|synthetic aperture radar","","1"

This is, particularly, true when risk and reward considerations are important. The approach suggested here proposes that classification need not offer a conclusion on every instance within a data set. If an algorithm finds instances (e.g., patient cases in a medical data set) in which attributes pertaining to a patient's disease offer zero to nil information, there should be no classification offered. From the physician's perspective, disclosure of nil information should be welcome because it might prevent potentially harmful treatment. It follows from this that the developer of a classifier can provide summary results amendable for helping the consumer decide whether or not it is prudent to pass or act (commission versus omission). It is not always about balancing sensitivity and specificity in all cases, but optimizing action on some cases. The explanation is centered on John Kelly's link of gambling with Shannon information theory. In addition, Graham's margin of safety, Bernoulli's utiles, and Hippocratic Oath are important. An example problem is provided using a Netherlands Cancer Institute breast cancer data set. Recurrence score, a popular molecular-based assay for breast cancer prognosis, was found to have an uninformative zone. The uninformative subset had been grouped with positive results to garner higher sensitivity. Yet, because of a positive result, patients might be advised to undergo potentially harmful treatment in the absence of useful information.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2363134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6936324&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6936324","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6936324","Breast cancer|Cancer|Classification|Data visualization|Information theory|Safety|Sensitivity and specificity|Shannon theory","cancer|information theory|medical diagnostic computing|molecular biophysics|patient diagnosis","","1"

An SyNerGized (SNG) routing protocol is devised to enable the proposed framework. Given perceived network information, SNG performs computations based on linear formulations and obtains an optimized route for packet delivery. To adapt to network dynamics, a reactive version of SNG, entitled Reactive SyNerGized (RSNG) routing protocol, is proposed to alleviate the network from constantly keeping track of link capacities within a certain scope of neighborhood. Since the downloading throughput may be bounded by either the internet gateway capacity &#x03BB;<sub>gw</sub> or ad hoc throughput &#x03BB;<sub>ah</sub>, RSNG judiciously propagates Route REQuest (RREQ) until the downloading throughput is bounded by &#x03BB;<sub>ah</sub> over the ad hoc domain, effectively eliminating unnecessary RREQ flooding. Our main objective is to improve achieved user downloading throughput via the cooperative (synergized) communication model and its corresponding routing mechanisms.

In this paper, we present a novel device with remote monitoring capabilities expressly conceived for the needs of rheumatic patients.

To overcome these deficiencies, robotic-assisted gait rehabilitation systems have been suggested. These systems have gained attentions from researchers and clinical practitioner in recent years.

The 2012 FGrC and NDVI measurements were fitted to MODIS NDVI, resulting in positive, linear relationships when the MODIS NDVI values were &#x2264; 0.80. Measured AGB was also positively, linearly related to MODIS summed NDVI, resulting in an overall R<sup>2</sup> of 0.81 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1397 kg/ha. Crop simulations were run for the fourteen paddocks from 2003 to 2006, and six paddocks from 2012. Four crop phenological points were selected to extract corresponding NDVI and simulated crop parameters: emergence, peak LAI, the mid-point between emergence and peak LAI, and anthesis. Linear models were fit between the MODIS NDVI and simulated values of FGrC, LAI, and AGB. Overall, the highest R<sup>2</sup> values corresponded to using all of the dates for FGrC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.82) and AGB (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92), and anthesis dates for LAI (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.74). For FGrC and AGB, the RMSE with simulated parameters were comparable or better than the equivalent results from the in situ measurements (note that there were no LAI in situ measurements to compare with). The results support the notion for extending the value of the MODIS NDVI using crop simulation models.

However, since the same piece of hardware can be used for both PUF and random number generation, the proposed principle offers an interesting low area mixed solution.","10.1109/TETC.2013.2287182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6648644&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6648644","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-6750","6648644","Computer architecture|Field programmable gate arrays|Hardware|Oscillators|Radiation detectors|Ring oscillators","elemental semiconductors|field programmable gate arrays|oscillators|silicon","","1"

For this study, hyperspectral imaging data covering the spectral region from 400 to 1000 nm were collected from an unmanned aerial vehicle visible/near-infrared imaging hyperspectrometer (UAV-VNIRIS). Theoretically, the spectral calibration parameters of the UAV-VNIRIS measured in the laboratory should be refined when applied to the hyperspectral data obtained from the UAV platform due to variations between the laboratory and actual flight environments. Therefore, accurate spectral calibration of the UAV-VNIRIS is essential to further applications of the hyperspectral data. Shifts in both the spectral center wavelength position and the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) were retrieved using two different methods (Methods I and II) based on spectrum matching of atmospheric absorption features at oxygen bands near 760 nm and water vapor bands near 820 and 940 nm. Comparison of the spectral calibration results of these two methods over the calibration targets showed that the derived center wavelength and FWHM shifts are similar. For the UAV-VNIRIS observed data used here, the shifts in center wavelength derived from both Methods I and II over the three absorption bands are less than 0.13 nm, and less than 0.22 nm in terms of FWHM. The findings of this paper revealed: 1) the UAV-VNIRIS payload on the UAV platform performed well in terms of spectral calibration; and 2) the applied methods are effective for on-orbit spectral calibration of the hyper spectrometer.","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2329891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6849968&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849968","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1939-1404","6849968","Atmospheric measurements|Calibration|Hyperspectral imaging|Optical surface waves|Radiometry|Wavelength measurement","geophysical image processing|hyperspectral imaging|remote sensing","","1"

Gas-fired generating units act as a link between the gas and electricity networks. The variability of wind power is, therefore, transferred to the gas network by influencing the gas demand for electricity generation. Operation of a GB integrated gas and electricity network considering the uncertainty in wind power forecast was investigated using three operational planning methods: deterministic, two-stage stochastic programming, and multistage stochastic programming. These methods were benchmarked against a perfect foresight model which has no uncertainty associated with the wind power forecast. In all the methods, thermal generators were controlled through an integrated unit commitment and economic dispatch algorithm that used mixed integer programming. The nonlinear characteristics of the gas network, including the gas flow along pipes and the operation of compressors, were taken into account and the resultant nonlinear problem was solved using successive linear programming. The operational strategies determined by the stochastic programming methods showed reductions of the operational costs compared to the solution of the deterministic method by almost 1%. Also, using the stochastic programming methods to schedule the thermal units was shown to make a better use of pumped storage plants to mitigate the variability and uncertainty of the net demand.","10.1109/TSTE.2013.2274818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6589136&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589136","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1949-3029","6589136","Compressors|Electricity|Programming|Stochastic processes|Uncertainty|Wind forecasting|Wind power generation","integer programming|linear programming|pipes|power generation dispatch|power generation planning|pumped-storage power stations|stochastic programming|thermal power stations|transmission networks|wind power","","1"

Closed-form factorizations of C-CSHTs and R-CSHTs have recently been proposed to make calculations more efficient. However, there is still room to find effective and general factorizations. This paper presents a simple closed-form complete factorization of C-CSHTs based on that of R-CSHTs. The proposed factorization can be applied to both C- and R-CSHTs with one factorization and it provides several benefits: 1) It can save total implementation costs for both C-CSHTs and R-CSHTs; 2) the generalized R-CSHT factorization significantly reduces its computational cost; 3) memory-saved local orientation detection of images can be achieved; 4) a fast direction-aware transform can be attained; 5) it clarifies that C- and R-CSHTs are closely related to common block transforms, such as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), binDCT, and HT; and 6) it achieves a new integer complex-valued transform, which can approximate the DFT better than the original C-CSHT.

The complexity of MPSoC makes it expensive and time consuming to fully analyze and test during the design stage. This has given rise to the trend of outsourcing design and fabrication of 3PIP components, that may not be trustworthy. To protect MPSoCs against malicious modifications, we impose a set of security-driven diversity constraints into the task scheduling step of the MPSoC design process, enabling the system to detect the presence of malicious modifications or to mute their effects during application execution. We pose the security-constrained MPSoC task scheduling as a multidimensional optimization problem, and propose a set of heuristics to ensure that the introduced security constraints can be fulfilled with a minimum impact on the other design goals such as performance and hardware. Experimental results show that without any extra cores, security constraints can be fulfilled within four vendors and 81% overhead in schedule length.","10.1109/TETC.2014.2348182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6879429&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6879429","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-6750","6879429","Image color analysis|Network security|Optimal scheduling|Scheduling|Trojan horses|Trust management","logic design|multiprocessing systems|optimisation|scheduling|system-on-chip|trusted computing","","1"

In this study, to realize radiation dose reduction by reducing the X-ray tube current and exposure time (mAs) in repeated CT scans, we propose a prior-image induced nonlocal (PINL) regularization for statistical iterative reconstruction via the penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) criteria, which we refer to as &#x201C;PWLS-PINL&#x201D;. Specifically, the PINL regularization utilizes the redundant information in the prior image and the weighted least-squares term considers a data-dependent variance estimation, aiming to improve current low-dose image quality. Subsequently, a modified iterative successive overrelaxation algorithm is adopted to optimize the associative objective function.

Measurements of the distribution of temperature along a 4 mm discharge showed that the regions including the arc roots do not have a higher temperature than the discharge column, despite appearing brighter. The introduction of a silicone rubber insulation surface adjacent to the discharge increased the discharge temperature, typically by ~160 K, and its energy per half cycle by 150%. The resulting temperature distribution on the insulation surface was captured by infrared thermal imaging. Finite element analysis (FEA) software successfully simulated heat transfer between discharge and surface, and showed good agreement with experimental results: highest temperatures being seen under the centre of the arc, where damage is also first seen in practice.

In the past, a separation between those with fiber in the access networks and those with wireless networks, the relatively low data-rate requirements of backhaul and the relatively large cell sites, have all combined to keep fiber deployment low in wireless backhaul. As fiber has penetrated the access network and the latest wireless standards have demanded smaller, higher bandwidth cells, fiber connectivity has become key. Choices remain as to where the demarcation between key elements should be in the network and whether fiber should be used as just a high data-rate backhaul path or if a transition to radio-over-fiber techniques can afford benefits.

The spectral characteristics of the grating were measured (i) in the laboratory with an ANDO AQ6317C optical spectrum analyzer and (ii) online, for the first time, with a LUNA OBR 4600 backscatter reflectometer, operating in the frequency acquisition mode. Such online measurement enables the study of recovery effects during the irradiation. The wavelength dip of the grating shifted under gamma irradiation, with 16 pm/kGy for the maximum total dose of 45 kGy.

By incorporating user head tracking and a spherical mirror, the method proposed enhances visual perception by simulating the depth cue of perspective viewing. The method interactively adjusts the viewing parameters to provide accurate perspective viewing of both the video stream (representing the physical environment) as well as the virtual objects superimposed within it.

The main contribution is the extension of particle swarm optimization (PSO) from the continuous domain to the binary or discrete domain. First, a novel bi-velocity strategy is developed to represent the possibilities of each dimension being 1 and 0. This strategy is suitable to describe the binary characteristic of the MRP, where 1 stands for a node being selected to construct the multicast tree, whereas 0 stands for being otherwise. Second, BVDPSO updates the velocity and position according to the learning mechanism of the original PSO in the continuous domain. This maintains the fast convergence speed and global search ability of the original PSO. Experiments are comprehensively conducted on all of the 58 instances with small, medium, and large scales in the Operation Research Library (OR-library). The results confirm that BVDPSO can obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions rapidly since it only needs to generate a few multicast trees. BVDPSO outperforms not only several state-of-the-art and recent heuristic algorithms for the MRP problems, but also algorithms based on genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, and PSO.","10.1109/TIE.2014.2314075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779598&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779598","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0278-0046","6779598","Communication networks|Multicast communication|Particle swarm optimization|Routing|Steiner trees","computational complexity|multicast communication|particle swarm optimisation|polynomials|telecommunication network routing|trees (mathematics)","","1"

We aim at minimizing the maximal MSE of the signal waveform estimation among all receivers subjecting to power constraints at the transmitters and all the relay nodes. This problem is highly nonconvex with matrix variables and the exactly optimal solution is very hard to obtain. We develop an iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the transmitter, relay, and receiver matrices by solving convex subproblems. By exploiting the optimal structure of the relay precoding matrices, we then propose a low complexity solution for the problem under some mild approximation. In particular, we show that under (moderately) high signal-to-noise ratio assumption, the min-max optimization problem can be solved using the semidefinite programming technique. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","10.1109/TWC.2014.2322361","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6811195&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6811195","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1536-1276","6811195","MIMO|Multicast communication|Receivers|Relays|Transmitters|Vectors|Wireless communication","MIMO communication|concave programming|convex programming|iterative methods|matrix algebra|mean square error methods|minimax techniques|multicast communication|precoding|radio transceivers|relay networks (telecommunication)","","1"

However, high power supply voltage is required in the conventional STT-MRAM writing circuit, which results in high power consumption (e.g., ~10 pJ/bit). In addition, it suffers from stochastic switching behavior and process voltage temperature variations. These make power-efficient and reliable write/read circuits become critical challenges. In this paper, we present novel circuits and architectures to build a 16 kb STT-MRAM design with low power and high reliability. For example, the self-enable switching scheme reduces the power consumption effectively and the fore-placed sense amplifier improves the robustness to process variation. Using an accurate compact model of 65 nm STT-MRAM and a commercial CMOS design kit, mixed transient and statistical simulations have been performed to validate this design.","10.1109/TMAG.2013.2291222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665113&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665113","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9464","6665113","Arrays|Reliability|Sensors|Switches|Switching circuits|Transistors|Writing","MRAM devices|amplifiers|energy consumption|magnetic sensors|magnetic switching|reliability","",""

Also of great interest are clinical and biological applications, namely monitoring patient response to treatment or characterizing activity at the molecular level. In biology, researchers seek to gain insight into gene functions and dynamics of biological processes, as well as potential perturbations of these leading to disease, through the study of patterns emerging from gene expression time series. Clustering can group genes exhibiting similar expression profiles, but focuses on global patterns denoting rather broad, unspecific responses. Biclustering reveals local patterns, which more naturally capture the intricate collaboration between biological players, particularly under a temporal setting. Despite the general biclustering formulation being NP-hard, considering specific properties of time series has led to efficient solutions for the discovery of temporally aligned patterns. Notably, the identification of biclusters with time-lagged patterns, suggestive of transcriptional cascades, remains a challenge due to the combinatorial explosion of delayed occurrences. Herein, we propose LateBiclustering, a sensible heuristic algorithm enabling a polynomial rather than exponential time solution for the problem.

We show by numerical computations that the group delay of an optical pulse of finite bandwidth transmitted through a piece of a low loss optical fiber of unit length is proportional to the energy stored by the standing wave electromagnetic field. The stored energy-group delay ratio typically approaches unity as the confinement loss converges to zero. In case of a dispersion tailored Bragg fiber, we found that the stored energy-group delay ratio decreased while the confinement loss increased compared to those of the standard quarterwave Bragg fiber configuration. Furthermore, a rapid variation in the group delay versus wavelength function due to mode-crossing events (in hollow core photonic bandgap fibers for instance) or resonances originating from slightly coupled cavities, surface or leaking modes in index guiding, photonic bandgap, or photonic crystal fibers always results in a rapid change in the mode-field distribution, which seriously affects splicing losses and focusability of the transmitted laser beam.

This non-destructive technique is able to reveal electrical trees, providing a threedimensional (3-D) view and therefore, a more complete representation of the phenomenon can be achieved. Moreover, taking virtual slices through the replica so created brings the possibility of internal exploration of the electrical tree, without the destruction of the specimen. Here, laboratory created electrical trees have been scanned using XCT with phase contrast enhancement, and 3-D virtual replicas created through which the trees are analyzed. Serial Block-Face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) is shown to be a successful complementary technique. Computed tomography enables quantification of electrical tree characteristics that previously were not available. Characteristics such as the diameter and tortuosity of tree channels, as well as the overall tree volume can be calculated. Through the cross-section analysis, the progression of the number of tree channels and the area covered by them can be investigated.

A dynamic MR image reconstruction method from partial ( k, t)-space measurements is introduced that recovers and inherently separates the information in the dynamic scene. The reconstruction model is based on a low-rank plus sparse decomposition prior, which is related to robust principal component analysis. An algorithm is proposed to solve the convex optimization problem based on an alternating direction method of multipliers. The method is validated with numerical phantom simulations and cardiac MRI data against state of the art dynamic MRI reconstruction methods. Results suggest that using the proposed approach as a means of regularizing the inverse problem remains competitive with state of the art reconstruction techniques.

In volcanic regions, the atmospheric phase delay effects can cause serious problems in detecting volcanic unrest because atmospheric thickness is inversely related with the elevation of a volcanic mountain. It is commonly known that the atmospheric phase screen (APS) can be decomposed spatially into stratified and turbulent components. In this paper, the stratified and turbulent atmospheric conditions of a volcanic area were simulated using weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, and the simulated atmospheric conditions were compared with in situ radiosonde data. The comparison results proved that the stratified APS from the WRF model could reflect the reasonable patterns of seasonal changes and vertical profiles with dependable quality. We also found that the stratified APS was significantly correlated with time and sometimes severely contaminated the quality of volcanic deformation estimation. These results indicate that the temporal high-pass (HP) filtering, which has been usually applied in time series InSAR analysis for extracting and removing APS, cannot work properly in volcanic area. Thus, we propose a new method that employs the stratified APS obtained from the WRF model by correlating with topography and the (residual) turbulent APS that can be effectively eliminated by temporal HP filtering in persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI). We applied the proposed method (atmosphere-corrected PSI) to Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array type L-band SAR data that cover Shinmoedake volcano, Japan, and found that the estimated surface deformation and APS agreed well with those measured from GPS and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, respectively.","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2264532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6547675&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6547675","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0196-2892","6547675","","Global Positioning System|atmospheric optics|geophysical signal processing|radar interferometry|remote sensing by radar|synthetic aperture radar|time series|topography (Earth)|volcanology","","1"

The collimated incident laser beam is divided into the reference arm and object arm. The latter propagates through the objective lens and then interferes with the slightly deflected reference beam that reflected back by a fixed mirror, giving rise to an interferential pattern on the CCD. Any amounts of defocusing can be directly indicated from the demodulated phase of the interferential pattern. In this manner, the focusing sensitivity at nanometer scale is experimentally attainable, which shows great superiority over traditional methods, particularly the limited focal length of current projective objective lens.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2326676","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6820728&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820728","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6820728","Charge coupled devices|Focusing|Interferometric lithography|Laser beams|Lenses|Optical interferometry","CCD image sensors|Michelson interferometers|focal planes|laser beams|light interference|light interferometry|mirrors|optical focusing|optical projectors|photolithography","","1"

When used correctly inhalers relieve and improve patients' symptoms. However, adherence to inhaler medication has been demonstrated to be poor, leading to reduced clinical outcomes, wasted medication, and higher healthcare costs. There is a clinical need for a system that can accurately monitor inhaler adherence as currently no method exists to evaluate how patients use their inhalers between clinic visits. This paper presents a method of automatically evaluating inhaler adherence through acoustic analysis of inhaler sounds. An acoustic monitoring device was employed to record the sounds patients produce while using a Diskus dry powder inhaler, in addition to the time and date patients use the inhaler. An algorithm was designed and developed to automatically detect inhaler events from the audio signals and provide feedback regarding patient adherence. The algorithm was evaluated on 407 audio files obtained from 12 community dwelling asthmatic patients. Results of the automatic classification were compared against two expert human raters. For patient data for whom the human raters Cohen's kappa agreement score was , results indicated that the algorithm's accuracy was 83% in determining the correct inhaler technique score compared with the raters. This paper has several clinical implications as it demonstrates the feasibility of using acoustics to objectively monitor patient inhaler adherence and provide real-time personalized medical care for a chronic respiratory illness.","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2310480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762909&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6762909","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2372","6762909","Acoustics|Algorithm design and analysis|Biomedical monitoring|Classification algorithms|Diseases|Respiratory diseases|Training","bioacoustics|biomedical equipment|biomedical measurement|diseases|drug delivery systems|feedback|medical signal detection|medical signal processing|patient monitoring|pneumodynamics|psychology|signal classification|telemedicine|telemetry","","1"

The wavelength of the optical carrier is adjusted according to the phase variation of the reference LO, to stabilize the delay of the fiber link. Once the delay of the link is stabilized, the phases of other LO signals that transferred through the same fiber link will all be stabilized.

The TID induced variations of charge transfer efficiency (CTE), pinning voltage, equilibrium full well capacity (EFWC), full well capacity (FWC) and dark current measured on the different pixel designs lead to the conclusion that only three degradation sources are responsible for all the observed radiation effects: the pre-metal dielectric (PMD) positive trapped charge, the TG sidewall spacer positive trapped charge and, with less influence, the TG channel shallow trench isolation (STI) trapped charge. The different FWC evolutions with TID presented here are in very good agreement with a recently proposed analytical model. This work also demonstrates that the peripheral STI is not responsible for the observed degradations and thus that the enclosed layout TG design does not improve the radiation hardness of PPD CIS.

These cells show an increase in open-circuit voltage (+57 mV), short-circuit current (+3.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>), and fill factor [9.5% (abs.)], compared with corresponding unpassivated reference cells, mainly due to improvements in rear surface passivation and rear internal reflection.

Cylindrical waves were transmitted at 4800 Hz with a transthoracic phased-array probe to achieve ultrafast Doppler imaging of the left ventricle. The high spatio-temporal sampling of ultrafast imaging permits reliance on a much more effective wall filtering and increased sensitivity when mapping blood flow patterns during the pre-ejection, ejection, early diastole, diastasis, and late diastole phases of the heart cycle.

They are intended for use as adapters, between instruments using overmoded WR-10 waveguide as input or output and sources propagating through free space. Unlike conventional waveguide-coupled antennas, a geometric optics analysis is more appropriate than a mode-by-mode electromagnetic calculation of impedance and far-field pattern. Six separate designs were studied, with input diameters from 5 to 16 mm, and &#x201C;throat&#x201D; diameters (i.e., diameters at the circular interface between cone and transition sections) of 1 to 4 mm. Measurements at 394 &#x03BC;m wavelength (760 GHz) using a far-IR waveguide laser beam indicate efficiencies of 40%-55%. The angular response is primarily determined by the Winston cone, and is well predicted by geometric optics theory, i.e., approximately constant out to an angle determined by the ratio of input to throat diameters. The efficiencies are primarily determined by the transition section, and for all concentrators are consistent with an average reflectance of 94% from the gold-plated, electroformed, interior surfaces. For each individual concentrator, efficiency variations with polarization, angular orientation and beamsize are below the measurement uncertainty.","10.1109/TTHZ.2013.2283371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6648689&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6648689","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2156-342X","6648689","Apertures|Laser beams|Measurement by laser beam|Optical waveguides|Prototypes|Waveguide lasers","geometrical optics|laser beams|optical couplers|optical design techniques|optical waveguides|submillimetre wave devices","","1"

To solve the node problem, the class of polytope codes is introduced. Polytope codes are constant composition codes operating over bounded polytopes in integer vector fields. The polytope structure creates additional complexity, but it induces properties on marginal distributions of code vectors so that validities of codewords can be checked by internal nodes of the network. It is shown that polytope codes achieve a cut-set bound for a class of planar networks. It is also shown that this cut-set bound is not always tight, and a tighter bound is given for an example network.","10.1109/TIT.2014.2314642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6781646&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781646","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9448","6781646","Educational institutions|Linear codes|Network coding|Upper bound|Vectors|Xenon","linear codes|network coding","","1"

In particular, when focusing on RFID targeted designs, it is important to evaluate their resistance against low-cost physical attacks. A low-cost fault injection attack can be mounted, for example, by lowering the supply voltage of the chip with the goal of causing setup time violations. In this paper, we provide an in-depth characterization of a chip implementation of the AES cipher. The chip has been designed using a 65-nm low-power standard cell library and operates in a subthreshold voltage range. We first show that it is possible to inject faults (through lowering the supply voltage) compliant with the fault models required to perform attacks against the AES cipher. We then investigate the possibility of predicting, at design time, which parts of the chip are more likely to be sensitive to such fault injection attacks and produce the desirable (from the point of view of the attacker) faulty behavior. Identifying such sensitive logic signals allows us to suggest to the designer a tailored countermeasure strategy for thwarting these attacks, with a minimal impact on the circuit's performance.","10.1109/TETC.2014.2316509","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6797908&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797908","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-6750","6797908","CMOS integrated circuits|Ciphers|Circuit faults|Encryption|Radiofrequency identification|Standards|Very large scale integration","VLSI|cryptography|electronic design automation|integrated circuit design|low-power electronics","","1"

Earlier works mainly focused on empirical studies of defending against the shrew DDoS, and very few of them provided analytic results about the attack itself. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for estimating attack effect of this stealthy type of DDoS. By originally capturing the adjustment behaviors of victim TCPs congestion window, our model can comprehensively evaluate the combined impact of attack pattern (i.e., how the attack is configured) and network environment on attack effect (the existing models failed to consider the impact of network environment). Henceforth, our model has higher accuracy over a wider range of network environments. The relative error of our model remains around 10% for most attack patterns and network environments, whereas the relative error of the benchmark model in previous works has a mean value of 69.57%, and it could be more than 180% in some cases. More importantly, our model reveals some novel properties of the shrew attack from the interaction between attack pattern and network environment, such as the minimum cost formula to launch a successful attack, and the maximum effect formula of a shrew attack. With them, we are able to find out how to adaptively tune the attack parameters (e.g., the DoS burst length) to improve its attack effect in a given network environment, and how to reconfigure the network resource (e.g., the bottleneck buffer size) to mitigate the shrew DDoS with a given attack pattern. Finally, based on our theoretical results, we put forward a simple strategy to defend the shrew attack. The simulation results indicate that this strategy can remarkably increase TCP throughput by nearly half of the bottleneck bandwidth (and can be higher) for general attack patterns.","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2321034","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6807757&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6807757","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1556-6013","6807757","Adaptation models|Bandwidth|Computer crime|Delays|Mathematical model|Packet loss|Throughput","Internet|computer network security|transport protocols","","1"

The method uses deep packet inspection on all DNS queries passing through the network and injects spoofed responses. Compared with other blocking mechanisms, DNS injection impacts uninvolved third-parties if their traffic is routed through a censored network. In this paper, we look for large deployments of DNS injection, measured from vantage points outside of the censored networks. DNS injection is known to be used in China since it leaked unintentionally into foreign networks. We find that DNS injection is also used in Iran and can be observed by sending DNS queries to Iranian networks.

The technique, referred to herein as &#x201C;delta modulation&#x201D; (DM), feeds the time-average output of a monobit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) back to the ADC input, but with opposite polarity. Assuming pseudostationary modulation statistics on the sampled RF waveform, the feedback signal corrects for aggregate dc offsets present in the ADC that otherwise degrade ADC sensitivity. Two RF integrated circuits (RFICs) are designed to demonstrate the approach. One uses analog DM to create the feedback signal; the other uses digital DM to achieve the same result. A series of tests validates the designs. The dynamic time-domain response confirms the feedback loop's basic operation. Measured output quantization imbalance, under noise-only input drive, significantly improves with the use of the DM circuit, even for large, deliberately induced dc offsets and wide temperature variation from -55 &#x00B0;C to +85 &#x00B0;C. Examination of the corrected versus uncorrected baseband spectrum under swept input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach for realistic radar and coherent receiver applications.

In a case study on presenting restaurant information, we show that an optimized IP strategy trained on Wizard-of-Oz data outperforms a baseline mimicking the wizard behavior in terms of total reward gained. The policy is then also tested with real users, and improves on a conventional hand-coded IP strategy used in a deployed SDS in terms of overall task success. The evaluation found that the trained IP strategy significantly improves dialogue task completion for real users, with up to a 8.2% increase in task success.

The CNT tube allows for flexible placement and distribution of X-ray focal spots in a system. Using a CNT tube, a computed tomography (CT) system with a noncircular geometry and a nonrotating gantry can be created. The noncircular CT geometry can be optimized around a specific imaging problem, utilizing the flexibility of CNT multibeam X-ray tubes to achieve the optimal focal spot distribution for the design constraints of the problem. Iterative reconstruction algorithms provide flexible CT reconstruction to accommodate the noncircular geometry. Compressed sensing-based iterative reconstruction algorithms apply a sparsity constraint to the reconstructed images that can partially account for missing angular coverage due to the noncircular geometry. In this paper, we present a laboratory prototype CT system that uses CNT multibeam X-ray tubes; a rectangular, nonrotating imaging geometry; and an accelerated compressed sensing-based iterative reconstruction algorithm.

The transient profile and the temporal accumulation of calcium signals have been suggested as the two main characteristics in which calcium cues encode messages to be forwarded to downstream pathways. We address the analytical quantification of calcium temporal-accumulation in a long, thin section of a nonexcitable cell by solving a boundary value problem. In these expressions we note that the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation is independent of every intracellular calcium flux and depends on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange across the membrane, cytosolic calcium diffusion, geometry of the cell, extracellular calcium perturbation, and initial concentrations. In particular, we analyse the time-integrated response of cytosolic calcium due to i) a localised initial concentration of cytosolic calcium and ii) transient extracellular perturbation of calcium. In these scenarios, we conclude that i) the range of calcium progression is confined to the vicinity of the initial concentration, thereby creating calcium microdomains; and ii) we observe a low-pass filtering effect in the response driven by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> perturbations. Additionally, we note that our methodology can be used to analyse a broader range of stimuli and scenarios.","10.1109/TCBB.2014.2316010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6784136&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784136","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1545-5963","6784136","Bioinformatics|Biological system modeling|Biomembranes|Computational biology","biodiffusion|bioelectric potentials|biomembrane transport|boundary-value problems|calcium|filtering theory|low-pass filters|muscle|reaction-diffusion systems","","1"

This paper presents a new alternative approach: the convolution operations are approximated by appropriate state-space models whose system responses can be conveniently computed by standard integration schemes.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate this phenomena and establish whether the safety margin of aging tests can be increased by changes in manufacture or test procedures. Using a number of cable types with different compositions and dimensions, the evolution of the absolute values of tensile strength and elongation at break upon aging was obtained. The results show that the major changes in mechanical properties happen within the first 24-48 h. This finding is valid both for ethylene vinylsilane copolymers and for grafted silane systems. In general, the effect is more pronounced for the 100&#x00B0;C compatibility test. Statistical analysis shows that insulation crosslinked in a hot waterbath will exhibit this behavior to a lesser extent, thus increasing the safety margin in aging tests, compared with ambient curing. This paper demonstrates that preconditioning at 70&#x00B0;C has no significant impact on aging properties. In addition, only small variations in mechanical properties were seen when changing the process parameters. It is concluded that further crosslinking is the principal cause of the phenomena under investigation.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2308919","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6758336&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6758336","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6758336","Aging|Cable insulation|Mechanical factors|Polyethylene|Power cables","ageing|elongation|fracture mechanics|polymer blends|statistical analysis|tensile strength|tensile testing","","1"

Measurements on 10 young healthy seated subjects quantified the behavior of the human ankle when muscles were active at 10% of maximum voluntary contraction. Stiffness, a linear approximation to static ankle mechanical impedance, was estimated from the continuous vector field. As with previous measurements when muscles were maximally relaxed, we found that ankle stiffness was highly direction-dependent, being weakest in inversion/eversion. Predominantly activating a single muscle or co-contracting antagonistic muscles significantly increased ankle stiffness in all directions but it increased more in the sagittal plane than in the frontal plane, accentuating the relative weakness of the ankle in the inversion-eversion direction. Remarkably, the observed increase was not consistent with simple superposition of muscle-generated stiffness, which may be due to the contribution of unmonitored deep ankle muscles.

Diagnostic catheterization is routinely used for pressure acquisition in vessels despite being subject to significant measurement errors. To investigate these errors, this study compares pressure measurement using two different techniques in vitro and numerical simulations. Pressure was acquired in a pulsatile flow phantom using a 6F fluid-filled catheter and a 0.014'' pressure wire, which is considered the current gold standard. Numerical simulations of the experimental set-up with and without a catheter were also performed. Despite the low catheter-to-vessel radius ratio, the catheter traces showed a 24% peak systolic pressure overestimation compared to the wire. The numerical models replicated this difference and indicated the cause for overestimation was the increased flow resistance due to the presence of the catheter. Further, the higher frequency pressure oscillations observed in the wire and numerical data were absent in the catheter, resulting in an overestimation of the pulse wave velocity with the latter modality. These results show that catheter geometry produces significant measurement bias in both the peak pressure and the waveform shape even with radius ratios considered acceptable in clinical practice. The wire allows for more accurate pressure quantification, in agreement with the numerical model without a catheter.","10.1109/TBME.2014.2308594","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748872&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6748872","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9294","6748872","Biomedical measurement|Catheters|Frequency measurement|In vitro|Numerical models|Pressure measurement|Wires","blood pressure measurement|blood vessels|cardiovascular system|catheters|diseases","","1"

M6 is extensively validated against two alternative spaceborne earth observation SPIH data sources and demonstrates good agreement. Further, due to the spectral and dual-view configuration of the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer imaging system, it is possible to automatically differentiate smoke from other atmospheric features effectively-a feat, which currently no other algorithm can achieve.

Pattern recognition allows for control of a greater number of degrees of freedom (DOF) than the conventional, EMG amplitude-based approach. Previous pattern recognition studies have shown benefit in placing electrodes directly over the reinnervated muscles. Localizing the optimal TMR locations is inconvenient and time consuming. In this contribution, we demonstrate that a clinically practical grid arrangement of electrodes yields real-time control performance that is equivalent to, or better than, the site-specific electrode placement for simultaneous control of multiple DOFs using pattern recognition. Additional findings indicate that grid-like electrode arrangement yields significantly lower classification errors for classifiers with a large number of movement classes (&gt;9).

Sufficient physiological studies have revealed that for a large number of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys and cats, neuronal responses elicited by the stimuli placed within the classical receptive field (CRF) are substantially modulated, normally inhibited, when difference exists between the CRF and its surround, namely, non-CRF, for various local features. The exquisite sensitivity of V1 neurons to the center-surround stimulus configuration is thought to serve important perceptual functions, including contour detection. In this paper, we propose a biologically motivated model to improve the performance of perceptually salient contour detection. The main contribution is the multifeature-based center-surround framework, in which the surround inhibition weights of individual features, including orientation, luminance, and luminance contrast, are combined according to a scale-guided strategy, and the combined weights are then used to modulate the final surround inhibition of the neurons. The performance was compared with that of single-cue-based models and other existing methods (especially other biologically motivated ones). The results show that combining multiple cues can substantially improve the performance of contour detection compared with the models using single cue. In general, luminance and luminance contrast contribute much more than orientation to the specific task of contour extraction, at least in gray-scale natural images.","10.1109/TIP.2014.2361210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6914612&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6914612","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1057-7149","6914612","Computational modeling|Feature extraction|Neurons|Vectors|Visual systems|Visualization","computer vision|object detection|physiology","","1"

The photonic and DLSPP waveguides are designed to reduce the loss and tapering region length of the coupling, and the tapering region is optimized. We achieve the coupling between the photonic and DLSPP waveguides based on a dielectric of refractive index of 1.57 with a coupling loss of 2.3 dB through a 3-&#x03BC;m-long coupling region. The coupling loss is further reduced by modifying the DLSPP waveguide into a double-DLSPP ( D<sup>2</sup>LSPP) waveguide. The D<sup>2</sup>LSPP waveguide has an additional low-index dielectric between its high-index dielectric and metal layer. Designed appropriately, the D<sup>2</sup>LSPP waveguide can be coupled to the photonic waveguide with a coupling loss of 1.1 dB through a 4-&#x03BC;m-long coupling region.

This paper proposes a modified asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) with low PAPR via introducing a recoverable upper-clipping (RoC) procedure. Although some information is clipped by a predetermined peak threshold, the clipped error information is kept and repositioned in our proposed scheme, which is named RoC-ACO-OFDM, instead of simply being dropped in conventional schemes. The proposed method makes full use of the specific structure of ACO-OFDM signals in the time domain, where half of the positions are forced to zeros within an OFDM symbol. The zero-valued positions are utilized to carry the clipped error information. Moreover, we accordingly present an optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection for the RoC-ACO-OFDM system. To facilitate the usage of RoC-ACO-OFDM in practical applications, an efficient detection method is further developed with near-optimal performance.

Task analytic models can be included in formal system models to allow HAI to be evaluated with model checking. However, previous work in this area has required analysts to manually formulate the properties to check. Such a practice can be prone to analyst error and oversight which can result in unexpected dangerous HAI conditions not being discovered. To address this, this paper presents a method for automatically generating specification properties from task models that enables analysts to use formal verification to check for system HAI problems they may not have anticipated.

In the United States, for example, spectrum has been reserved in the 700-MHz band for an LTE-based public safety network. The key requirement for the evolving broadband PPDR and NSPS services capable systems is to provide access to cellular services when the infrastructure is available and to efficiently support local services even if a subset or all of the network nodes become dysfunctional due to public disaster or emergency situations. This paper reviews some of the key requirements, technology challenges, and solution approaches that must be in place in order to enable LTE networks and, in particular, D2D communications, to meet PPDR and NSPS-related requirements.

Current state-of-the-art computer models built upon such datasets account for increasingly finer anatomical details, however, structural discontinuities at the paracellular level are typically discarded in the model generation process, owing to the significant costs which incur when using high resolutions for explicit representation. In this study, a novel discontinuous finite element (dFE) approach for discretizing the bidomain equations is presented, which accounts for fine-scale structures in a computer model without the need to increase spatial resolution. In the dFE method, this is achieved by imposing infinitely thin lines of electrical insulation along edges of finite elements which approximate the geometry of discontinuities in the intracellular matrix. Simulation results demonstrate that the dFE approach accounts for effects induced by microscopic size scale discontinuities, such as the formation of microscopic virtual electrodes, with vast computational savings as compared to high resolution continuous finite element models. Moreover, the method can be implemented in any standard continuous finite element code with minor effort.","10.1109/TBME.2013.2292320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6671927&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671927","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9294","6671927","Computational modeling|Extracellular|Finite element analysis|Frequency modulation|Image resolution|Iron|Mathematical model","biomedical electrodes|cellular biophysics|diseases|electrocardiography|finite element analysis|image resolution|image segmentation|medical image processing","","1"

We model eye and head as a sphere, or ellipsoid, rotating about its center, or about its south pole, where the axes of rotation are physiologically constrained, as was proposed originally by Listing and Donders. The Donders' constraint is either derived from Fick gimbals or from observed rotation data of adult human head. The movement dynamics is derived on SO(3) or on a suitable submanifold of SO(3) after describing a Lagrangian. Using two forms of parametrization, the axis-angle and Tait-Bryan, the motion dynamics is described as an Euler-Lagrange's equation, which is written together with an externally applied control torque. Using the control system, so obtained, we propose a class of optimal control problem that minimizes the norm of the applied external torque vector. Our control objective is to point the eye or head, toward a stationary point target, also called the regulation problem. The optimal control problem has also been analyzed by writing the dynamical system as a Newton-Euler's equation using angular velocity as part of the state variables. In this approach, explicit parametrization of SO(3) is not required.

Detecting such problems is not easy because (i) many bugs manifest themselves only after prolonged operation; (ii) reasoning about semantic errors requires a machine-readable specification; and (iii) the state space of complex protocol implementations is large. This article presents a novel approach that combines symbolic execution and rule-based specifications to detect various types of flaws in network protocol implementations. The core idea behind our approach is to (1) automatically generate high-coverage test input packets for a network protocol implementation using single- and multi-packet exchange symbolic execution (targeting stateless and stateful protocols, respectively) and then (2) use these packets to detect potential violations of manual rules derived from the protocol specification, and check the interoperability of different implementations of the same network protocol. We present a system based on these techniques, SymbexNet, and evaluate it on multiple implementations of two network protocols: Zeroconf, a service discovery protocol, and DHCP, a network configuration protocol. SymbexNet is able to discover non-trivial bugs as well as interoperability problems, most of which have been confirmed by the developers.","10.1109/TSE.2014.2323977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6815719&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6815719","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0098-5589","6815719","Computer bugs|Concrete|IP networks|Interoperability|Protocols|Servers|Testing","formal specification|open systems|program debugging|program testing","","1"

At the core of many of these methods lie reliable workload-prediction techniques that guide in identifying servers, time intervals, and other parameters that are needed for building sustainability solutions based on techniques like virtualization and server consolidation for server systems. Many workload prediction methods have been proposed in the recent paper, but unfortunately they do not deal adequately with the issues that arise specifically in large-scale server systems, viz., extensive nonstationarity of server workloads, and massive online streaming data. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing two online ensemble learning methods for workload prediction, which address these issues in large-scale server systems.

The interactions between the antenna and layered medium are thereby inherently accounted for. The fields are calculated using 3-D Green's functions.

To facilitate practical task-based image-quality assessment, model observers are needed as approximate surrogates for human observers. In cardiac-gated SPECT imaging, diagnosis relies on evaluation of the myocardial motion as well as perfusion. Model observers for the perfusion-defect detection task have been studied previously, but little effort has been devoted toward development of a model observer for cardiac-motion defect detection. In this work, we describe two model observers for predicting human observer performance in detection of cardiac-motion defects. Both proposed methods rely on motion features extracted using previously reported deformable mesh model for myocardium motion estimation. The first method is based on a Hotelling linear discriminant that is similar in concept to that used commonly for perfusion-defect detection. In the second method, based on relevance vector machines (RVM) for regression, we compute average human observer performance by first directly predicting individual human observer scores, and then using multi reader receiver operating characteristic analysis. Our results suggest that the proposed RVM model observer can predict human observer performance accurately, while the new Hotelling motion-defect detector is somewhat less effective.","10.1109/TMI.2013.2279517","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6584807&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584807","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0278-0062","6584807","Feature extraction|Image sequences|Kernel|Myocardium|Observers|Predictive models|Single photon emission computed tomography","cardiology|feature extraction|haemodynamics|medical disorders|medical image processing|motion estimation|muscle|physiological models|regression analysis|single photon emission computed tomography|support vector machines","","1"

The power ratio between the odd- (or even-) order sidebands is tunable by adjusting the RF power. Moreover, the power and the phase of the optical carrier can be independently tunable by adjusting the biases of the MZM2 and the parent MZM of the DPMZM, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a channel aware successive relaying protocol, also referred to as CAO-SIR, which is capable of thoroughly mitigating inter-relay interference by carefully adapting relays' transmission order and rate. In particular, a relay having a poorer link to the source is scheduled first to forward a message, the data rate of which is adapted to the link quality of the source-relay and relay-destination channels. By this means, each relay may decode the messages intended for the preceding relays, and then cancel these relays' interference in a low complexity which is equal to that of Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE). To further optimize and analyze CAO-SIR, we present its equivalent parallel relay channel model, based upon which the adaptive relay selection and power allocation schemes are proposed. By employing M half duplex relays, CAO-SIR is capable of achieving an diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) given by d(r) = max (M + 1) 1- {(M+2/M+1r)} , (1 - r) , where d(r) and r denote the diversity and multiplexing gains, respectively. Its DMT asymptotically approaches the DMT upper bound achieved by (M + 1) &#x00D7; 1 MISO systems or M full duplex relays, when M is large.","10.1109/TWC.2014.2363453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926805&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926805","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1536-1276","6926805","Cooperative communication|Decoding|Interference cancellation|Power distribution|Relays|Wireless communication","MIMO communication|computational complexity|cooperative communication|decision feedback equalisers|decoding|diversity reception|interference suppression|protocols|radio links|relay networks (telecommunication)|wireless channels","","1"

Calculation of the impedance matrix elements in the form of an infinite series of waveguide modes is cast into the form of a 2-D discrete Fourier transform allowing for fast FFT-accelerated matrix fill operations (MFOs).

Previous to VIIRS, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (OLS) measured radiances that spanned over seven orders of magnitude, using an onboard gain adjustment to provide the capability to image atmospheric features across the solar terminator, to observe nighttime light emissions over the globe, and to monitor the global distribution of clouds. The VIIRS DNB detects radiances that span over eight orders of magnitude, and because it has 13-14-b quantization (compared with 6 b for OLS) with three gain stages, the DNB has its full dynamic range at every part of the scan. One process that is applied to the VIIRS DNB radiances is a solar/lunar zenith angle dependent gain adjustment to create near-constant contrast (NCC) imagery. The at-launch NCC algorithm was designed to reproduce the OLS capability and, thus, was constrained to solar and lunar angles from 0&#x00B0; to 105&#x00B0;. This limitation has, in part, lead to suboptimal imagery due to the assumption that DNB radiances fall off exponentially beyond twilight. The VIIRS DNB ultrasensitivity in low-light conditions enables it to detect faint emissions from a phenomenon called airglow, thus invalidating the exponential fall-off assumption. Another complication to the NCC imagery algorithm is the stray light contamination that contaminates the DNB radiances in the astronomical twilight region. We address these issues and develop a solution that leads to high-quality imagery for all solar and lunar conditions.","10.1109/TGRS.2014.2306132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762963&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6762963","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0196-2892","6762963","Clouds|Dynamic range|Lighting|Moon|Signal processing algorithms|Stray light|Table lookup","airglow|clouds|infrared imaging|optical variables measurement|quantisation (signal)|radiometers|stray light","","1"

The information content of the signal with respect to the retrieved parameters is analyzed in a stochastic framework using two common criteria: the degrees of freedom for a signal and the Shannon information content. It is found that oxygen A-band measurements with moderate spectral resolution (0.2 nm) provide two pieces of independent information that allow the accurate retrieval of cloud-top height together with either cloud optical thickness or cloud fraction. Additionally, our results confirm previous studies indicating that the retrieval of cloud geometrical thickness (CGT) from single-angle measurements is not reliable in this spectral region.

The four algorithms increased ankle stiffness throughout stance, decreased knee stiffness during terminal stance, as well as provided powered ankle plantarflexion and knee swing initiation through modifications of equilibrium positions of the ankle and knee, respectively. Seven amputees (knee disarticulation and transfemoral levels) walked at slow, comfortable, and hurried speeds on level and inclined (10&#x00B0;) surfaces. The prosthesis was tuned at their comfortable level ground walking speed. We further quantified trends in prosthetic knee and ankle kinematics, and kinetics across conditions. Subjects modulated their walking speed by &#x00B1;25% (average) from their comfortable speeds. As speed increased, increasing ankle angles and velocities as well as stance phase ankle power and plantarflexion torque were observed. At slow and comfortable speeds, plantarflexion torque was increased on the incline. At slow and comfortable speeds, stance phase positive knee power was increased and knee torque more flexor on the incline. As speed increased, knee torque became less flexor on the incline. These algorithms were shown to generalize well across speed, produce gait mechanics that compare favorably with non-amputee data, and display evidence of scalable device function.

It can be triggered by solitary highly energetical charge carriers or by excitation of multiple vibrational modes of the bond. In addition, we show that the influence of electron-electron scattering (EES), the dipole-field interaction, and the dispersion of the Si-H bond energy are crucial for understanding and modeling HCD.

When the biological material is subjected to an external electric field, local changes in its electrical properties become sources of magnetic field perturbations, which are detectable by the MR signals. Controlling the external excitation and measuring the responses using an MRI scanner, we can formulate the imaging problem as an inverse problem in which unknown tissue properties are recovered from the acquired MR signals. This inverse problem is nonlinear; it involves the incorporation of Maxwell's equations and Bloch equations during data acquisition. Each method for visualizing internal conductivity and permittivity distributions has its own methodological limitations, and is restricted to imaging only a part of the ensemble or mean tissue structures or states. Therefore, imaging methods can be improved by developing complementary methods that can employ the beneficial aspects of various existing techniques.

We present an approach to understand water network operations that uses only the static information of the network. Specifically, we analyze water networks using augmented centrality measures. We use readily available static information about network elements (e.g., diameters of pipes) rather than calibrated dynamic information (e.g., roughness coefficients of pipes, demands at nodes), and model each network element appropriately for analysis using customized centrality measures. Our approach identifies: 1) pipes carrying higher flows; 2) nodes with higher delivery heads; and 3) pipes with higher failure impact. Each of the above helps in determining strategic instrumentation locations. We validate our analysis by comparison with fully calibrated hydraulic models for three benchmark topologies. Our experimental evaluation shows that centrality analysis yields results which have a match of more than 85% with those obtained using calibrated hydraulic models on benchmark networks without significant over-provisioning.

Afterward, boosting and neural networks, as classification methods, are used to handle occlusion and enhance stereo matching by finding the erroneous disparity values. These values are then corrected through a completion stage. The accuracy of the proposed implementation improves on the problem in an efficient manner. A timing analysis of the method is provided to validate the real time performance. This paper further clarifies some of the possible developments based on various discussions.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2322101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6819773&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819773","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6819773","Classification|IEEE standards|Real-time systems|Stereo matching","image classification|image matching|learning (artificial intelligence)|neural nets|stereo image processing","","1"

By doing this, the interference can be better aligned to the symbols of interest, thus reducing the power required to cancel it. The scaling is performed by forming a constrained optimization problem, solved with existing well-known techniques, which entails an increase in the computational complexity at the base station. To quantify this trade-off in performance and complexity, a study of the impact in the signal processing load is carried out by means of a power efficiency analysis.

Of these methods, the so-called long term jitter method is significantly less computationally expensive. We therefore use this method to investigate the influence of the delay time, feedback strength, and amplitude-phase coupling on the timing jitter. Our results show that, with vanishing amplitude-phase coupling, greater timing jitter reduction can be achieved with long delay times and larger feedback strengths, when feedback is near resonance.

Method. We performed SLR based on the search of digital libraries. We implemented four second order mutation (SOM) strategies, in addition to first order mutation (FOM), and compared them from different perspectives. Results. Our SLR identified 17 relevant techniques (in 22 articles) and three categories of techniques: detecting (DEM); suggesting (SEM); and avoiding equivalent mutant generation (AEMG). The experiment indicated that SOM in general and JudyDiffOp strategy in particular provide the best results in the following areas: total number of mutants generated; the association between the type of mutation strategy and whether the generated mutants were equivalent or not; the number of not killed mutants; mutation testing time; time needed for manual classification.

The index gratings play a role in selectively transmitting the incident beam carrying the periodic grating pattern of a code scale. The beam router, consisting of a collimating lens in conjunction with a prism, is used to collimate and steer the beam originating from a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) toward the code scale. The proposed encoder is rigorously designed by ray optic simulations and manufactured by passively aligning a smart frame, which is produced by plastic injection molding, with a VCSEL at &#x03BB; = 850 nm and two semicircular photodetectors. The index grating is created by forming an Al grating pattern of a 10- &#x03BC;m pitch on a silica substrate. Two output signals provide sinusoidal signals, which are 90 &#x00B0; out of phase from each other. The period of the signals is 4 &#x03BC;s at a frequency of 250 kHz, which is equivalent to a period of 10 &#x03BC;m.

This paper addresses three main problems: 1) how to increase the computational and energy efficiency of computers and to reduce their size and weight; 2) how to achieve human-like versatility in intelligence; and 3) likewise for human-like adaptability in intelligence. Regarding the first problem, the SP system has the potential for substantial gains in computational efficiency, with corresponding cuts in energy consumption and the bulkiness of computers: 1) by reducing the size of data to be processed; 2) by exploiting statistical information that the system gathers as an integral part of how it works; and 3) via a new version of Donald Hebb's concept of a cell assembly. Toward human-like versatility in intelligence, the SP system has strengths in unsupervised learning, natural language processing, pattern recognition, information retrieval, several kinds of reasoning, planning, problem solving, and more, with seamless integration among structures and functions. The SP system's strengths in unsupervised learning and other aspects of intelligence may help in achieving human-like adaptability in intelligence via: 1) one-trial learning; 2) learning of natural language; 3) learning to see; 4) building 3-D models of objects and of a robot's surroundings; 5) learning regularities in the workings of a robot and in the robot's environment; 6) exploration and play; 7) learning major skills; and 8) learning via demonstration.

Performance analyses show that absolute calibration accuracy better than 0.25 K is achievable for temperature sounding channels in the 50-60-GHz band for a total-power radiometer using a weakly coupled noise diode for frequent calibration and proximal GPSRO measurements for infrequent (approximately daily) calibration. The method requires GPSRO penetration depth only down to the stratosphere, thus permitting the use of a relatively small GPS antenna. Furthermore, only coarse spacecraft angular knowledge (approximately one degree rms) is required for the technique, as more precise angular knowledge can be retrieved directly from the combined radiometer and GPSRO data, assuming that the radiometer angular sampling is uniform. These features make the technique particularly well suited for implementation on a low-cost CubeSat hosting both radiometer and GPSRO receiver systems on the same spacecraft. We describe a validation platform for this calibration method, the Microwave Radiometer Technology Acceleration (MiRaTA) CubeSat, currently in development for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Science Technology Office.

This converter is able to generate a multilevel ac voltage and since its stacks of cells consist of H-bridge cells instead of half-bridge cells, they are able to generate higher ac voltage than the dc terminal voltage. This allows the AAC to operate at an optimal point, called the &#x201C;sweet spot,&#x201D; where the ac and dc energy flows equal. The director switches in the AAC are responsible for alternating the conduction period of each arm, leading to a significant reduction in the number of cells in the stacks. Furthermore, the AAC can keep control of the current in the phase reactor even in case of a dc-side fault and support the ac grid, through a STATCOM mode.

The simulation of those physical systems represents the environment for sophisticated control and energy management algorithms that can be tested on the platform. The concept of this work is to combine commercial-off-the-shelf software packages, here simulators and runtime infrastructure (RTI), to a high performance multidomain cosimulation platform. The high performance of the platform regarding computation time has been achieved by exploiting the parallel computing capabilities of modern simulation servers. Especially the computation time of large numbers of instances of Modelica-based models has been reduced significantly by the development of the parallel execution framework (PEF). The implementation of the PEF, including the interface to the individual models and to the RTI, is described in detail. The partitioning of the simulated system among different simulators does not influence the simulation results, as shown on the basis of a small-scale simulation scenario.

Although many community detection (CD) algorithms have been proposed, most of them were designed primarily for networks containing only positive links. Thus, it is important to design CD algorithms which can handle large-scale SNs. To this purpose, we first extend the original similarity to the signed similarity based on the social balance theory. Then, based on the signed similarity and the natural contradiction between positive and negative links, two objective functions are designed to model the problem of detecting communities in SNs as a multiobjective problem. Afterward, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, called MEAsSN. In MEAs-SN, to overcome the defects of direct and indirect representations for communities, a direct and indirect combined representation is designed. Attributing to this representation, MEAs-SN can switch between different representations during the evolutionary process. As a result, MEAs-SN can benefit from both representations. Moreover, owing to this representation, MEAs-SN can also detect overlapping communities directly. In the experiments, both benchmark problems and large-scale synthetic networks generated by various parameter settings are used to validate the performance of MEAs-SN. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficacy of MEAs-SN on networks with 1000, 5000, and 10000 nodes and also in various noisy situations. A thorough comparison is also made between MEAs-SN and three existing algorithms, and the results show that MEAs-SN outperforms other algorithms.","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2305974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6755451&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755451","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2267","6755451","Communities|Decoding|Evolutionary computation|Linear programming|Social network services|Time complexity|Vectors","complex networks|evolutionary computation|network theory (graphs)","","1"

Several new extensions of the TP model transformation are proposed, such as the quasi and &#x201C;full,&#x201D; compact and rank-reduced higher order singular-value-decomposition-based canonical form of T-S fuzzy models, and the bilinear-, multi, pseudo-, convex-, partial TP model transformations. All of these extensions together form the generalized TP model transformation, which provides an effective tool to freely and readily manipulate the antecedent sets and rules of T-S fuzzy models and also provides main fuzzy rule component analysis, as well as a means for complexity and accuracy tradeoffs. It is demonstrated in this paper that the proposed manipulation forms a new, effective, and necessary optimization step of T-S fuzzy or polytopic models and linear-matrix-inequality-based control design, and can also decrease conservativeness. Identification techniques are typically constructed according to the available data and measurement set, as well as the type of system to be identified. As a result, they may not always provide good representations for control design frameworks. This paper demonstrates that the proposed TP model transformation is unique in that it bridges between various soft-computing-based identification techniques and T-S fuzzy model-based approaches. Finally, this paper proposes the multi-TP model transformation, which is a tractable and nonheuristic framework to verify the stability of the result of fuzzy or various soft-computing-based control designs. The multi-TP model transformation could provide an answer to the frequently emerging criticisms regarding the lack of mathematical stability verification techniques in the soft-computing-based control design.

This paper considers frequency-domain spread asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) systems in indoor diffuse channels and aims to develop efficient data detection and code channel allocation schemes. By exploiting the frequency-domain spread concept, a linear multi-code detection scheme is proposed to maximize the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver. The achieved SINR and bit error ratio (BER) performance are analyzed.

A cost-benefit analysis approach using the M-OPF model as the calculation engine is proposed to determine the preferred VSC-MTDC alternative to be installed in an existing ac transmission system. In this approach, the operational benefits of VSC-MTDC systems are evaluated against their investment costs to derive the benefit-to-cost ratios (BCR) which reflect the cost-effectiveness of the alternatives. A case study has been carried out using a modified Nordic 32-bus system. The results of the study show that VSC-MTDC systems might lead to a reduction in total operation cost, and the reduction of the total system transmission loss depends to a large extent on the VSC-MTDC configuration. The results from sensitivity analyses show that if the VSC loss could be reduced to a third of the original level, the total benefit from the system would be increased by about 70%.

To fully realize this potential, there is a need for a common way to abstract the heterogeneity of devices so that their functionality can be represented as a virtual computing platform. To this end, we present novel semantic level interoperability architecture for pervasive computing and IoTs. There are two main principles in the proposed architecture. First, information and capabilities of devices are represented with semantic web knowledge representation technologies and interaction with devices and the physical world is achieved by accessing and modifying their virtual representations. Second, global IoT is divided into numerous local smart spaces managed by a semantic information broker (SIB) that provides a means to monitor and update the virtual representation of the physical world. An integral part of the architecture is a resolution infrastructure that provides a means to resolve the network address of a SIB either using a physical object identifier as a pointer to information or by searching SIBs matching a specification represented with SPARQL. We present several reference implementations and applications that we have developed to evaluate the architecture in practice. The evaluation also includes performance studies that, together with the applications, demonstrate the suitability of the architecture to real-life IoT scenarios. In addition, to validate that the proposed architecture conforms to the common IoT-A architecture reference model (ARM), we map the central components of the architecture to the IoT-ARM.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2347992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6879461&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6879461","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6879461","Computer architecture|Context awareness|Interoperability|Pervasive computing|Resource description framework|Semantics|Sensors","Internet of Things|knowledge representation|open systems|semantic Web","","1"

These techniques include linear regression, mixture of linear experts (ME), multilayer-perceptron, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). They are investigated offline with electro-myographic signals acquired from ten able-bodied subjects and one person with congenital upper limb deficiency. The control accuracy is reported as a function of the number of electrodes and the amount and diversity of training data providing guidance for the requirements in clinical practice. The results showed that KRR, a nonparametric statistical learning method, outperformed the other methods. However, simple transformations in the feature space could linearize the problem, so that linear models could achieve similar performance as KRR at much lower computational costs.

In the region of interest, plasmons-induced potential fluctuations are existent in nature and hence constitute the origin of apparent bandgap narrowing. In this letter, we extract the underlying potential fluctuations directly from the enhanced minority-carrier injection experiment published in the literature. The core of the extraction lies in a combination of the two existing theoretical frameworks. First, the Gaussian distribution can serve as a good approximation of potential fluctuations. Second, no change can be made in the real bandgap between fluctuating conduction- and valence-band edges. Extracted potential fluctuations come from plasmons, as verified by our published temperature dependences of plasmons limited mobility in the inversion layer of MOSFETs as well as theoretical calculation results on bulk silicon.

Biologists and chemists need to quickly explore and evaluate potentially effective yet safe compounds based on many datasets that are in relationship with each other. However, there is a lack of tools that support them in these processes. To remedy this, we developed ConTour, an interactive visual analytics technique that enables the exploration of these complex, multi-relational datasets. At its core ConTour lists all items of each dataset in a column. Relationships between the columns are revealed through interaction: selecting one or multiple items in one column highlights and re-sorts the items in other columns. Filters based on relationships enable drilling down into the large data space. To identify interesting items in the first place, ConTour employs advanced sorting strategies, including strategies based on connectivity strength and uniqueness, as well as sorting based on item attributes. ConTour also introduces interactive nesting of columns, a powerful method to show the related items of a child column for each item in the parent column. Within the columns, ConTour shows rich attribute data about the items as well as information about the connection strengths to other datasets. Finally, ConTour provides a number of detail views, which can show items from multiple datasets and their associated data at the same time. We demonstrate the utility of our system in case studies conducted with a team of chemical biologists, who investigate the effects of chemical compounds on cells and need to understand the underlying mechanisms.","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346752","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875994&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6875994","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1077-2626","6875994","Biomedical informatics|Data visualization|Drugs|Large-scale systems|Proteins|Visual analytics","chemistry computing|data analysis|data visualisation|sorting","","1"

Generally, the sequential implementation of both RBMs and backpropagation algorithm takes significant amount of computational time to process massive data sets. The emerging big data learning requires distributed computing for the DBNs. In this paper, we present a distributed learning paradigm for the RBMs and the backpropagation algorithm using MapReduce, a popular parallel programming model. Thus, the DBNs can be trained in a distributed way by stacking a series of distributed RBMs for pretraining and a distributed backpropagation for fine-tuning.

In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for scheduling and spectrum allocation with the objective of maximizing the network's throughout subject to a delay constraint. During each time slot, the scheduling and spectrum allocation problems involve selecting a subset of links to be activated, and based on spectrum sensing outcomes, allocate the available resources to these links. This problem is addressed as an aggregate utility maximization problem. Since the throughput of any data flow is limited by the throughput of the weakest link along its end-to-end path, the utility of each flow is chosen as a function of this weakest link's throughput. The throughput and delay performance of the network are characterized using a queueing theoretic analysis, and throughput is maximized via the application of Lagrangian duality theory. The dual decomposition framework decouples the problem into a set of subproblems that can be solved locally, hence, it allows us to develop a scalable distributed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the fast convergence rates of the proposed algorithm, as well as significant performance gains compared to conventional design methods.","10.1109/TMC.2013.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746172&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746172","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1536-1233","6746172","Availability|Cognitive radio|Interference|Mesh networks|Resource management|Sensors|Throughput","access protocols|cognitive radio|optimisation|radio spectrum management|resource allocation|scheduling|signal detection|wireless mesh networks","","1"

Therefore, the conventional method cannot always utilize all edges of the original graph in a single stage transformation. Our method is based on oversampling of the underlying graph itself, and it can append nodes and edges to the graph somewhat arbitrarily. We use this approach to make one oversampled bipartite graph that includes all edges of the original non-bipartite graph.

This paper compares a vehicle-based paradigm (where a single operator individually assigns tasks to unmanned assets) to a task-based paradigm (where the operator generates a task list, which is then given to the group of vehicles that determine how to best divide the tasks among themselves.) The results demonstrate significant advantages in using a task-based paradigm for both overall performance and robustness to increased workload. This effort also demonstrated that while previous video gaming experience mattered for performance, the degree of experience that demonstrated benefit was minimal.

In addition to the as-fabricated DDV at time-zero, aging induces a time-dependent DDV (TDDV). Bias temperature instability (BTI) is a dominant aging process. A number of techniques have been developed to characterize the BTI, including the conventional pulse-(I) -(V) , random telegraph noises, time-dependent defect spectroscopy, and TDDV accounting for the within-device fluctuation. These techniques, however, cannot be directly applied to SRAM, because their test conditions do not comply with typical SRAM operation. The central objective of this paper is to develop a technique suitable for characterizing both the negative BTI (NBTI) and positive BTI (PBTI) in SRAM. The key issues addressed include the SRAM relevant sensing Vg, measurement delay, capturing the upper envelope of degradation, sampling rate, and measurement time window. The differences between NBTI and PBTI are highlighted. The impact of NBTI and PBTI on the cell-level performance is assessed by simulation, based on experimental results obtained from individual devices. The simulation results show that, for a given static noise margin, test conditions have a significant effect on the minimum operation bias.","10.1109/TED.2014.2335053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6866905&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866905","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9383","6866905","Degradation|MOSFET|Random access memory|Stress|Stress measurement|Time measurement|Video recording","SRAM chips|ageing|integrated circuit noise|negative bias temperature instability|random noise","","1"

Therefore, DML is suitable for applying in TWDM-PON to achieve a high loss budget. Moreover, the frequency chirp induced dispersion of directly-modulated signal is managed thanks to the combination of optical spectral reshaping and dispersion supported transmission effects, which makes it possible for the directly-modulated signal to reach a distance of 100 km and still with a good quality.

However, building a statistical motion model across different subjects remains a challenging task, especially for a complex joint like the wrist. We present a novel framework for simultaneous registration and segmentation of multiple 3-D (CT or MR) volumes of different subjects at various articulated positions. The framework starts with a pose model generated from 3-D volumes captured at different articulated positions of a single subject (template). This initial pose model is used to register the template volume to image volumes from new subjects. During this process, the Grow-Cut algorithm is used in an iterative refinement of the segmentation of the bone along with the pose parameters. As each new subject is registered and segmented, the pose model is updated, improving the accuracy of successive registrations. We applied the algorithm to CT images of the wrist from 25 subjects, each at five different wrist positions and demonstrated that it performed robustly and accurately. More importantly, the resulting segmentations allowed a statistical pose model of the carpal bones to be generated automatically without interaction. The evaluation results show that our proposed framework achieved accurate registration with an average mean target registration error of 0.34 &#x00B1;0.27 mm. The automatic segmentation results also show high consistency with the ground truth obtained semi-automatically. Furthermore, we demonstrated the capability of the resulting statistical pose and shape models by using them to generate a measurement tool for scaphoid-lunate dissociation diagnosis, which achieved 90% sensitivity and specificity.","10.1109/TMI.2013.2285503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6630071&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6630071","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0278-0062","6630071","Bones|Image segmentation|Joints|Mathematical model|Radio access networks|Three-dimensional displays|Wrist","biomedical MRI|bone|computerised tomography|diseases|image registration|image segmentation|iterative methods|medical image processing|statistical analysis","","1"

This paper provides an overview of the concept of environmentally sustainable mobile computing and identifies reduction in manufacturing energy costs and electronic waste generated as two important outcomes that can be achieved by increasing device lifespan. Increased device lifespans, however, are possible only if the underlying market forces support such a paradigm shift. This paper develops an analytical economic framework as it applies to mobile phones by analyzing a market scenario of two firms competing under a differentiated Bertrand duopoly model. The framework and its analysis helps verify intuitions about the reasons that affect a firm's decision to offer an environmentally sustainable choice for consumers and considers the feasibility, possible benefits, and challenges in increasing device lifespan, including technical challenges.

Spaceborne stereo data from Cartosat-1 are able to cover large areas on the one hand, but hold a lower geometric resolution on the other hand. In this paper, we investigate to which extent the geometric shortcomings of Cartosat-1 can be overcome integrating building footprints from topographic maps for the derivation of large-area building models. Therefore, we describe the methodology to derive digital surface models (DSMs) from Cartosat-1 data and the derivation of building footprints from topographic maps at 1:25 000 (DTK25). Both data are fused to generate building block models for four metropolitan regions in Germany with an area of ~ 16 000 km<sup>2</sup>. Building block models are further aggregated to 1 &#x00D7; 1 km grid cells and volume densities are computed. Volume densities are classified to various levels of UMCs. Performance evaluation of the building block models reveals that the building footprints are larger in the DTK-25, and building heights are lower with a mean absolute error of 3.21 m. Both factors influence the building volume, which is linearly lower than the reference. However, this error does not affect the classification of UMC, which can be classified with accuracies between 77% and 97%.","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2346655","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6887291&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6887291","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1939-1404","6887291","Accuracy|Buildings|Cities and towns|Data mining|Data models|Remote sensing|Urban areas","cartography|digital elevation models|geophysical image processing|image classification|optical radar|remote sensing by radar|spaceborne radar|stereo image processing|topography (Earth)","","1"

In the midline injury group, SSEPs recorded from the contralateral forelimb region of the primary somatosensory cortex were 59.7% (CI 34.7%, 84.8%; c<sup>2</sup> = 21.9; dof = 1; p = 2.9 &#x00D7;10<sup>-6</sup>) greater than the laminectomy group; SSEPs from the ipsilateral somatosensory cortex were 47.6% (CI 18.3%, 77%; c<sup>2</sup> = 10.1; dof = 1; p = 0.001) greater. Activation of the ipsilateral somatosensory cortex was further supported by BOLD-fMRI, which showed increased oxygenation at the ipsilateral hemisphere at day seven post-injury. In the unilateral injury group, ipsilesional side was compared to the contralesional side. SSEPs on day 14 (148%; CI 111%, 185%) and day 21 (137%; CI 110%, 163%) for ipsilesional forelimb stimulation were significantly increased over baseline (100%). SSEPs recorded from the hindlimb sensory cortex upon ipsilesional stimulation were 33.9% (CI 14.3%, 53.4%; c<sup>2</sup> = 11.6; dof = 1; p = 0.0007) greater than contralesional stimulation. Therefore, these results demonstrate the ability of SSEPs to detect significant enhancements in the activation of forelimb sensory pathways following both midline and unilateral contusive SCI at T8. Reorganization of forelimb pathways may occur after thoracic SCI, which SSEPs can monitor to aid the development of future therapie- .","10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2319313","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6807805&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6807805","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1534-4320","6807805","Educational institutions|Electrodes|Fasteners|Injuries|Rats|Skin|Spinal cord","bioelectric potentials|biomedical MRI|image enhancement|injuries|medical image processing|neurophysiology|patient monitoring|somatosensory phenomena","","1"

The architectures' primary feature is the use of on-chip nMOS gate capacitors as intermediate power storage elements to decouple the power supply from internal low-power modules processing sensitive data. The proposed countermeasures are algorithm independent and allow different tradeoffs between security protection and the incurred overheads. Test benches of the proposed architectures were simulated in 65-nm TSMC CMOS technology. A correlation PAA was performed for each test bench targeting a custom implementation of the advanced encryption standard subbytes operation. All architectures were found to resist the correlation PAA at the power supply, with the more complex architectures also offering protection against invasive attacks. The success value indicator was used to analyze the effectiveness of the countermeasures. It was found that all architectures provided a negative value at the power supply, showing protection against PAAs. We demonstrate that the use of nMOS gate capacitors can help to increase security and present a feasibility analysis focused on the needed decoupling capacitances.","10.1109/TETC.2014.2303934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6730921&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6730921","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-6750","6730921","Capacitors|Computer architecture|Cryptography|Encryption|Nanoscale devices|Power demand","CMOS integrated circuits|capacitors|cryptography|nanoelectronics","","1"

It consisted of automatically segmenting fetal anatomical structures to measure standard obstetric biometric parameters, from 2D fetal ultrasound images taken on fetuses at different gestational ages (21 weeks, 28 weeks, and 33 weeks) and with varying image quality to reflect data encountered in real clinical environments. Four independent sub-challenges were proposed, according to the objects of interest measured in clinical practice: abdomen, head, femur, and whole fetus. Five teams participated in the head sub-challenge and two teams in the femur sub-challenge, including one team who tackled both. Nobody attempted the abdomen and whole fetus sub-challenges. The challenge goals were two-fold and the participants were asked to submit the segmentation results as well as the measurements derived from the segmented objects. Extensive quantitative (region-based, distance-based, and Bland-Altman measurements) and qualitative evaluation was performed to compare the results from a representative selection of current methods submitted to the challenge. Several experts (three for the head sub-challenge and two for the femur sub-challenge), with different degrees of expertise, manually delineated the objects of interest to define the ground truth used within the evaluation framework. For the head sub-challenge, several groups produced results that could be potentially used in clinical settings, with comparable performance to manual delineations. The femur sub-challenge had inferior performance to the head sub-challenge due to the fact that it is a harder segmentation problem and that the techniques presented relied more on the femur's appearance.","10.1109/TMI.2013.2276943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6575204&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6575204","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0278-0062","6575204","Biomedical imaging|Head|Image segmentation|Magnetic heads|Ultrasonic imaging|Ultrasonic variables measurement","biomedical ultrasonics|image segmentation|medical image processing|obstetrics","","1"

Although the soft classification and spectral unmixing techniques can obtain an abundance of different classes in a pixel to solve the mixed pixel problem, the subpixel spatial attribution of the pixel will still be unknown. The subpixel mapping technique can effectively solve this problem by providing a fine-resolution map of class labels from coarser spectrally unmixed fraction images. However, most traditional subpixel mapping algorithms treat all mixed pixels as an identical type, either boundary-mixed pixel or linear subpixel, leading to incomplete and inaccurate results. To improve the subpixel mapping accuracy, this paper proposes an adaptive subpixel mapping framework based on a multiagent system for remote-sensing imagery. In the proposed multiagent subpixel mapping framework, three kinds of agents, namely, feature detection agents, subpixel mapping agents and decision agents, are designed to solve the subpixel mapping problem. Experiments with artificial images and synthetic remote-sensing images were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed subpixel mapping algorithm in comparison with the hard classification method and other subpixel mapping algorithms: subpixel mapping based on a back-propagation neural network and the spatial attraction model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other two subpixel mapping algorithms in reconstructing the different structures in mixed pixels.","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2244095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6479297&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6479297","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0196-2892","6479297","Algorithm design and analysis|Feature extraction|Image reconstruction|Multi-agent systems|Optimization|Remote sensing","geophysical image processing|image classification|multi-agent systems|neural nets|remote sensing","","1"

Two experiments were conducted to validate the method. One is a gesture recognition experiment in which we categorize gesture motions by two kinds of models with indexes of similarity and estimation that use left singular vectors. The proposed method obtained a higher correct categorization ratio than principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation efficiency (CE).

The proposed structure employs four circular-shaped DD patch radiator antenna elements fed by a 1-to-4 Wilkinson power divider. To improve the array radiation characteristics, a ground structure based on a compact uniplanar electromagnetic bandgap unit cell has been used. The DD patch shows better radiation and total efficiencies compared with the metallic patch radiator. For further gain improvement, a dielectric layer of a superstrate is applied above the array antenna. The measured impedance bandwidth of the proposed array antenna ranges from 27 to beyond 32 GHz for a reflection coefficient (S11) of less than -10 dB.

Based on the vector of each pixel constructed by computing the values between the referenced pixel and the adjacent pixels with diverse distances from different directions, the vector representation of the referenced pixel is generated to provide the 1D structure of micropatterns. With the devise of pairwise direction of vector for each pixel, the LVP reduces the feature length via comparative space transform to encode various spatial surrounding relationships between the referenced pixel and its neighborhood pixels. Besides, the concatenation of LVPs is compacted to produce more distinctive features. To effectively extract more detailed discriminative information in a given subregion, the vector of LVP is refined by varying local derivative directions from the (n) th-order LVP in ((n-1)) th-order derivative space, which is a much more resilient structure of micropatterns than standard local pattern descriptors. The proposed LVP is compared with the existing local pattern descriptors including local binary pattern (LBP), local derivative pattern (LDP), and local tetra pattern (LTrP) to evaluate the performances from input grayscale face images. In addition, extensive experiments conducting on benchmark face image databases, FERET, CAS-PEAL, CMU-PIE, Extended Yale B, and LFW, demonstrate that the proposed LVP in high-order derivative space indeed performs much better than LBP, LDP, and LTrP in face recognition.","10.1109/TIP.2014.2321495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6809981&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6809981","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1057-7149","6809981","Encoding|Face|Face recognition|Feature extraction|Image coding|Transforms|Vectors","face recognition|image representation|visual databases","","1"

The upstream signals are used as secure keys for corresponding ONUs. Then the encrypted downstream signals are sent to the ONU sides, where the downstream signal can be retrieved by applying xor operation again between the encrypted downstream signal and the stored upstream signal. Since each ONU cannot obtain the upstream signals of other ONUs, only the ONU itself can recover its downstream signal from the encrypted downstream signal. Moreover, the secure key is dynamically changing along with the upstream signal, significantly improving the security of the downstream signal for the OFDM-PON system. A 5-Gb/s 16-quadrature amplitude modulation OFDM signal with xor-based encryption has been successfully implemented over a 25-km standard single-mode fiber.

The goal is to learn a prediction model by incorporating information from the source domain that is able to generalize well on the target test instances. We consider an explicit form of transformation functions and especially linear transformations that maps examples from the source to the target domain, and we argue that by proper preprocessing of the data from both source and target domains, the feasible transformation functions can be characterized by a set of rotation matrices. This naturally leads to an optimization formulation under the special orthogonal group constraints. We present an iterative coordinate descent solver that is able to jointly learn the transformation as well as the model parameters, while the geodesic update ensures the manifold constraints are always satisfied.

Natural and artificial wetlands are of high importance for different livelihoods, particularly during the dry season, from October/November until May. However, wetlands largely go unmonitored. In this work, remote sensing is used to monitor wetlands in semiarid Burkina Faso over large areal extents along a gradient of different rainfall and land use characteristics. Time series of data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) from 2000 to 2012 is used for near-infrared (NIR)-based water monitoring using a latitudinal threshold gradient approach. The occurrence of 21 new water bodies with a size larger than 0.5 km<sup>2</sup> over the 13-year analysis period results from a postclassification change detection. Yearly cumulative spatiotemporal analysis shows lower water extents in the drought seasons of 2000-2001, 2004-2005, and 2011-2012. Multiple wetlands indicate a positive trend toward a larger yearly maximum area, but a negative trend toward shorter flooding duration. Such a negative trend is observed particularly for natural wetlands. The temporal behavior of five selected case studies demonstrates that monthly negative anomalies of watercovered areas coincide with the occurrence of drought seasons. The successful application of remote sensing time series as a tool to monitor wetlands in semiarid regions is presented, and the potential of novel early warning indicators of drought from remote sensing is demonstrated.","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2336875","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6875901&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6875901","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1939-1404","6875901","Earth|Indexes|MODIS|Monitoring|Remote sensing|Time series analysis|Water resources","lakes|land use|rain|remote sensing","","1"

Initially, rapid channel variation is addressed, which is characterized in the frequency domain as a Doppler spread. It is then shown that, for typical Doppler spreads, the in-vehicle channel is underspread, and therefore, the information capacity approaches the capacity achieved with perfect receiver channel state information in the infinite bandwidth limit. Measurements are performed for a number of channel variation scenarios (e.g., absorptive motion, reflective motion, one antenna moving, and both antennas moving) at a number of carrier frequencies and for a number of cavity loading scenarios. It is found that the Doppler spread increases with carrier frequency; however, the type of channel variation and loading appear to have little effect. Channel variation over a longer time period is also measured to characterize the slower channel variation. Channel variation is a function of the cavity occupant motion, which is difficult to model theoretically; therefore, an empirical model for the slow channel variation is proposed, which leads to an improved estimate of the channel state.","10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2328635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6825811&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6825811","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0090-6778","6825811","Antenna measurements|Cavity resonators|Doppler effect|Frequency measurement|Receivers|Reverberation chambers|Vehicles","mobile radio|radio receivers|wireless channels","","1"

In the context of big data, to quickly build a service path with the optimal global QoS has become a problem demanding prompt solution. Sociologists point out that companies prefer familiar partners in the commercial environment. Using this principle, a concept of partner circle is defined, which can significantly reduce the search space in path planning. Combining path planning with service composition, a PartnerFirst algorithm is presented based on the social network, which is the cooperation network of service providers here. Simulation experiment shows that the PartnerFirst algorithm outperforms current approaches over 10 times in efficiency, with just about 10% loss in QoS.

The relationship between gases and faults, and the percentage of missing values in an instance are used as a basis for the imputation ordering; whereas the plausible values for the missing values are estimated from k-nearest neighbor instances in the imputation estimator, and the iterative imputation allows complete and incomplete instances in a DGA dataset to be utilized iteratively for imputing all the missing values.

Various schemes based on split-step Fourier techniques to solve the nonlinear Schro&#x0308;dinger equation (NLSE), which describes the propagation in optical fibers, are compared. In general, the schemes in which the loss operator is combined with nonlinearity operator are found to be more computationally efficient than the schemes in which the loss is combined with dispersion. When the global error is large, the schemes with variable step size outperform the ones with uniform step size. The schemes based on local error and/or minimum area mismatch (MAM) further improve the computational efficiency. In this scheme, by minimizing the area mismatch between the exponential profile and its stepwise approximation, an optimal step size distribution is found. The optimization problem is solved by the steepest descent algorithm. The number of steps to get the desired accuracy is determined by the local error method. The proposed scheme is found to have higher computational efficiency than the other schemes studied in this paper. For QPSK systems, when the global error is 10<sup>-8</sup>, the number of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) needed for the conventional scheme (loss combined with dispersion and uniform step size) is 5.8 times that of the proposed scheme.

The prime movers behind this trend are LEDs, microwave, and more recently, power electronics. New areas of research also include spintronics and nanoribbon transistors, which leverage some of the unique properties of GaN. GaN has electron mobility comparable with silicon, but with a bandgap that is three times larger, making it an excellent candidate for high-power applications and high-temperature operation. The ability to form thin-AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, which exhibit the 2-D electron gas phenomenon leads to high-electron mobility transistors, which exhibit high Johnson's figure of merit. Another interesting direction for GaN research, which is largely unexplored, is GaN-based micromechanical devices or GaN microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). To fully unlock the potential of GaN and realize new advanced all-GaN integrated circuits, it is essential to cointegrate passive devices (such as resonators and filters), sensors (such as temperature and gas sensors), and other more than Moore functional devices with GaN active electronics. Therefore, there is a growing interest in the use of GaN as a mechanical material. This paper reviews the electromechanical, thermal, acoustic, and piezoelectric properties of GaN, and describes the working principle of some of the reported high-performance GaN-based microelectromechanical components.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive DE (ADE) algorithm with a new mutation strategy DE/lbest/1 and a two-level adaptive parameter control scheme. The DE/lbest/1 strategy is a variant of the greedy DE/best/1 strategy. However, the population is mutated under the guide of multiple locally best individuals in DE/lbest/1 instead of one globally best individual in DE/best/1. This strategy is beneficial to the balance between fast convergence and population diversity. The two-level adaptive parameter control scheme is implemented mainly in two steps. In the first step, the population-level parameters F<sub>p</sub> and CR<sub>p</sub> for the whole population are adaptively controlled according to the optimization states, namely, the exploration state and the exploitation state in each generation. These optimization states are estimated by measuring the population distribution. Then, the individual-level parameters F<sub>i</sub> and CR<sub>i</sub> for each individual are generated by adjusting the population-level parameters. The adjustment is based on considering the individual's fitness value and its distance from the globally best individual. This way, the parameters can be adapted to not only the overall state of the population but also the characteristics of different individuals. The performance of the proposed ADE is evaluated on a suite of benchmark functions. Experimental results show that ADE generally outperforms four state-of-the-art DE variants on different kinds of optimization problems. The effects of ADE components, parameter properties of ADE, search behavior of ADE, and parameter sensitivity of ADE are also studied. Finally, we investigate the capability of ADE for solving three real-world optimization problems.","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2279211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6588590&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6588590","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2267","6588590","Convergence|Diversity reception|Optimization|Process control|Sociology|Statistics|Vectors","adaptive control|benchmark testing|convergence|evolutionary computation|greedy algorithms|optimisation","","1"

A 2-D identification of the intrinsic PA operation modes is performed first at the current source reference planes. For intrinsic modes defined without lossy parasitics, most of the required source impedance terminations will exhibit a substantial negative resistance after projection to the external reference planes.

Therefore, cost minimization has become an emergent issue for the upcoming big data era. Different from conventional cloud services, one of the main features of big data services is the tight coupling between data and computation as computation tasks can be conducted only when the corresponding data are available. As a result, three factors, i.e., task assignment, data placement, and data movement, deeply influence the operational expenditure of data centers. In this paper, we are motivated to study the cost minimization problem via a joint optimization of these three factors for big data services in geo-distributed data centers. To describe the task completion time with the consideration of both data transmission and computation, we propose a 2-D Markov chain and derive the average task completion time in closed-form. Furthermore, we model the problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming and propose an efficient solution to linearize it.

In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source.

The maximum output power of the laser is 581 mW, and the slope conversion efficiency is 18.8% with the threshold pump power of 2.1 W. The design of the FPF used as output mirror, including the relationship between FWHM and spectral separation, peak wavelength location, and peak transmission, are discussed. Compared with the coupled-cavity, etalon, or specially coated mirror methods, the FPF method presented in this paper is both easy in the selection of oscillating wavelength and simple in design and fabrication.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2345884","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6872535&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6872535","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6872535","Band-pass filters|Cavity resonators|Fabry-Perot|Mirrors|Optical filters|Pump lasers","band-pass filters|laser cavity resonators|laser mirrors|neodymium|optical design techniques|optical filters|optical pumping|semiconductor lasers|solid lasers","","1"

An emerging research topic in data mining, known as privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM), has been extensively studied in recent years. The basic idea of PPDM is to modify the data in such a way so as to perform data mining algorithms effectively without compromising the security of sensitive information contained in the data. Current studies of PPDM mainly focus on how to reduce the privacy risk brought by data mining operations, while in fact, unwanted disclosure of sensitive information may also happen in the process of data collecting, data publishing, and information (i.e., the data mining results) delivering. In this paper, we view the privacy issues related to data mining from a wider perspective and investigate various approaches that can help to protect sensitive information. In particular, we identify four different types of users involved in data mining applications, namely, data provider, data collector, data miner, and decision maker. For each type of user, we discuss his privacy concerns and the methods that can be adopted to protect sensitive information. We briefly introduce the basics of related research topics, review state-of-the-art approaches, and present some preliminary thoughts on future research directions. Besides exploring the privacy-preserving approaches for each type of user, we also review the game theoretical approaches, which are proposed for analyzing the interactions among different users in a data mining scenario, each of whom has his own valuation on the sensitive information. By differentiating the responsibilities of different users with respect to security of sensitive information, we would like to provide some useful insights into the study of PPDM.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2362522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6919256&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6919256","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6919256","Algorithm design and analysis|Computer security|Data mining|Data privacy|Game theory|Privacy|Tracking","Big Data|data acquisition|data mining|data protection|game theory|security of data","","1"

The accuracy from querying by singing/humming is improved. Our method can be divided into two phases. In the first phase, we find the possible search results. This is similar to the conventional singing/humming query process. During the second phase, the musical preference of the user is utilized to rank the possible search results again.

In this region, satellite remote sensing of ecosystem productivity is useful for evaluating black spruce forest status and recovery processes. The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) by green leaves is a particularly important input parameter for ecosystem models. FAPAR<sub>1d</sub> is computed as the ratio of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR<sub>3d</sub>) to the incident photosynthetically active radiation at the horizontal plane above the canopy (PAR<sub>1d</sub>, FAPAR<sub>1d</sub> = APAR<sub>3d</sub>/PAR<sub>1d</sub>). The parameter FAPAR<sub>1d</sub> is scale dependent and can be larger than 1 as a result of laterally incident PAR. We investigated the dependence of FAPAR<sub>1d</sub> on spatial scale in an open-canopy black spruce forest in interior Alaska. We compared FAPAR<sub>1d</sub> with FAPAR<sub>3d</sub>( = APAR<sub>3d</sub>/PAR<sub>3d</sub>), the latter of which considers incident PAR as actinic flux (spheradiance) (PAR<sub>3d</sub>). Our results showed the following: 1) landscape scale FAPAR<sub>3d</sub>(30&#x00D7;30 m<sup>2</sup>) was always larger (0.39-0.43) than FAPAR<sub>1d</sub> (0.19-0.27) due to the landscape heterogeneity and incident PAR regime, and 2) at the individual tree scale, FAPAR<sub>1d</sub> was highly variable, with 34% (day of year [DOY] 180) to 52% (DOY 258) of , whereas FAPAR<sub>3d</sub> varied across a much narrower range (0.2-0.5).

Our exact analytical expressions describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for simultaneously compensating astigmatism in two arms of a sequence of two off-axis curved mirrors. The theoretical results indicate that, when the astigmatism compensation expressions are satisfied, the astigmatism introduced by a folded curved mirror can be mutually compensated by another folded curved mirror, even if there is no additional Brewster element inside the cavity. The astigmatism can only be successfully eliminated by using a pair of concave mirrors or convex mirrors. Our analytical expressions can be used to design astigmatically compensated folded resonators without a Brewster element. A typical side-pumped z-shaped cavity Nd:YAG laser is employed to demonstrate the astigmatic compensation. Experimental measurements of the pattern of the laser output beam show that not only the spot intensity profile deformation but, in addition, the phase distortion in the two terminal arms can be simultaneously compensated completely in the cavity, which is in good agreement with the analytical predictions.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2366160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6945338&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945338","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6945338","Laser beams|Laser cavity resonators|Laser noise|Lenses|Mirrors|Optical resonators","aberrations|laser beams|laser cavity resonators|laser mirrors|neodymium|solid lasers","","1"

The sensitivity of in vivo brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy biomarkers is investigated with respect to parameter values for two key stages of post-acquisitional processing. Our effort is specifically motivated by the lack of consensus on approaches and parameter values for the two critical operations, water resonance removal, and baseline correction. The different stages of data processing also introduce varying levels of uncertainty and arbitrary selection of parameter values can significantly underutilize the intrinsic differences between two classes of signals. The sensitivity of biomarkers points to the need for a better understanding of how all stages of post-acquisitional processing affect biomarker discovery and ultimately, clinical translation. Our results also highlight the possibility of optimizing biomarker discovery by the careful selection of parameters that best reveal class differences. Using previously reported data and biomarkers, our results demonstrate that small changes in parameter values affect the statistical significance and corresponding effect size of biomarkers.

You pick it up to ear level and listen, shake it, and then listen again. To you, the basic principle of active sensing is quite clear - first absorb, then, if there is no movement or sound, shake it, and then reabsorb. We propose an extremely basic hypothesis for the active sensing of haptic interaction with dynamical systems. Our hypothesis asserts that in order to improve the efficiency of extracting information from a probed system, the sensor should act according to the following basic principle: if the probed system is passive, the sensor should be active; conversely, when the probed system is active, the sensor should be passive. We proved the proposed principle for interaction with a second-order mechanical system with the goal to enhance classification performance between two possible sine power sources. We showed that the addition of an active power source to a passive testing sensor leads to decreased sensitivity in the amplitude and frequency of the tested power source. Further, an extension of this principle is provided, presenting the conditions for reduced sensitivity to spring and damper parameters. To test its applicability for a linear system in a noisy environment, a computer simulation was performed demonstrating that classification performance improved by following the proposed principle. At last, ten subjects probed an active virtual system under either active or passive conditions. A comparison of the mean just-noticeable difference of both conditions indicated significantly better sensitivity was obtained by following the principle.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2313581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778786&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6778786","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6778786","Audio systems|Data mining|Haptic interfaces|Mechanical systems|Sensitivity|Sensors|Testing","haptic interfaces|sensitivity analysis","","1"

That accumulation causes significant changes in the electrical properties of the lung tissues, which in turn can be detected using microwave techniques. To that end, the design and implementation of an automated ultrahigh-frequency microwave-based system for CHF detection and monitoring is presented. The hardware of the system consists of a wideband folded antenna attached to a fully automated vertical scanning platform, compact microwave transceiver, and laptop. The system includes software in the form of operational control, signal processing, and visualizing algorithms. To detect CHF, the system is designed to vertically scan the rear side of the human torso in a monostatic radar approach. The collected data from the scanning is then visualized in the time domain using the inverse Fourier transform. These images show the intensity of the reflected signals from different parts of the torso. Using a differential based detection technique, a threshold is defined to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy cases.

The MRRs can be used as filter devices, where generation of high-frequency (GHz) soliton signals as single and multicarriers can be performed using suitable system parameters. Here, the optical soliton in a nonlinear fiber MRR system is analyzed, using a modified add/drop system known as a Panda ring resonator connected to an add/drop system. In order to set up a transmission system, i.e., IEEE802.11a, first, 64 uniform optical carriers were generated and separated by a splitter and modulated; afterward, the spectra of the modulated optical subcarriers are overlapped, which results one optical OFDM channel band. The quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and 16-QAM are used for modulating the subcarriers. The generated OFDM signal is multiplexed with a single-carrier soliton and transmitted through the single-mode fiber (SMF). After photodetection, the radio frequency (RF) signal was propagated. On the receiver side, the RF signal was optically modulated and processed. The results show the generation of 64 multicarriers evenly spaced in the range from 54.09 to 55.01 GHz, where demodulation of these signals is performed, and the performance of the system is analyzed.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2302791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725601&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6725601","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6725601","Nonlinear optics|OFDM|Optical fibers|Optical filters|Optical ring resonators|Optical solitons|Optical transmitters","OFDM modulation|micromechanical resonators|optical communication|optical modulation|optical solitons|wireless LAN","","1"

We propose efficient power aware routing (EPAR), a new power aware routing protocol that increases the network lifetime of MANET. In contrast to conventional power aware algorithms, EPAR identifies the capacity of a node not just by its residual battery power, but also by the expected energy spent in reliably forwarding data packets over a specific link. Using a mini-max formulation, EPAR selects the path that has the largest packet capacity at the smallest residual packet transmission capacity. This protocol must be able to handle high mobility of the nodes that often cause changes in the network topology. This paper evaluates three ad hoc network routing protocols (EPAR, MTPR, and DSR) in different network scales, taking into consideration the power consumption.

The term suppression refers to a reduction in the response growth of one tone in the presence of a second tone. Suppression is a salient feature of normal cochlear processing and contributes to psychophysical masking. Suppression is evident in many measurements of cochlear function in subjects with normal hearing, including distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Suppression is also evident, to a lesser extent, in subjects with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. This paper describes a hearing-aid signal-processing strategy that aims to restore both loudness growth and two-tone suppression in hearing-impaired listeners. The prescription of gain for this strategy is based on measurements of loudness by a method known as categorical loudness scaling. The proposed signal-processing strategy reproduces measured DPOAE suppression tuning curves and generalizes to any number of frequency components. The restoration of both normal suppression and normal loudness has the potential to improve hearing-aid performance and user satisfaction.","10.1109/TBME.2013.2276351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6574223&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574223","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9294","6574223","Auditory system|Delays|Filter banks|Frequency measurement|Gain measurement|IIR filters|Speech","ear|hearing|medical disorders|medical signal processing|otoacoustic emissions","","1"

Landsat 5 data on the 1998 Indian and Pakistani tests are used here to demonstrate that there are detectable changes in surface features which might be used to localize an underground nuclear test and to develop change detection techniques specific to the use of satellite data to support a CTBT on-site inspection. Landsat 5 has been active for over 20 years providing repeat coverage of the Earth's surface every 16 days. Most locations have Landsat data available for a variety of dates, allowing for statistical analysis of the data to understand temporal trends and data variability on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Given the right conditions, these usual patterns of change (such as seasonal changes or weathering) can be discerned from unusual patterns of change, such as features relating to a UNE. This paper extends known change detection techniques to a temporal series of data and shows that multispectral change detection can be used to help localize a UNE.","10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2294322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6730730&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6730730","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1939-1404","6730730","Earth|Inspection|Remote sensing|Satellites|Shape|Standards|Vectors","geophysical techniques|nuclear explosions|remote sensing|statistical analysis","","1"

We design the resulting grid/cloud to be resilient against network link or server failures. To this end, we exploit relocation: Under failure conditions, a grid job or cloud virtual machine may be served at an alternate destination (i.e., different from the one under failure-free conditions). We thus consider grid/cloud requests to have a known origin, but assume a degree of freedom as to where they end up being served, which is the case for grid applications of the bag-of-tasks (BoT) type or hosted virtual machines in the cloud case. We present a generic methodology based on integer linear programming (ILP) that: chooses a given number of sites in a given network topology where to install server infrastructure; and determines the amount of both network and server capacity to cater for both the failure-free scenario and failures of links or nodes. For the latter, we consider either failure-independent (FID) or failure-dependent (FD) recovery. Case studies on European-scale networks show that relocation allows considerable reduction of the total amount of network and server resources, especially in sparse topologies and for higher numbers of server sites. Adopting a failure-dependent backup routing strategy does lead to lower resource dimensions, but only when we adopt relocation (especially for a high number of server sites): Without exploiting relocation, potential savings of FD versus FID are not meaningful.","10.1109/TNET.2013.2283924","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6642129&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6642129","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1063-6692","6642129","Bandwidth|Data models|Network topology|Optical fiber networks|Routing|Servers|WDM networks","cloud computing|grid computing|integer programming|linear programming|network servers|optical fibre networks|optical links|telecommunication computing|telecommunication network reliability|telecommunication network routing|telecommunication network topology|virtual machines","","1"

C-Sens detects changes in physical distance between the residual limb and the prosthesis. The sensing front ends are built into the prosthetic socket without contacting the skin. This novel signal source improves the usability of locomotion mode recognition systems based on electromyography (EMG) signals and systems based on capacitance signals obtained from skin contact. To evaluate the performance of C-Sens, we carried out experiments among six transtibial amputees with varying levels of amputation when they engaged in six common locomotive activities. The capacitance signals were consistent and stereotypical for different locomotion modes. Importantly, we were able to obtain sufficiently informative signals even for amputees with severe muscle atrophy (i.e., amputees lacking of quality EMG from shank muscles for mode classification). With phase-dependent quadratic classifier and selected feature set, the proposed system was capable of making continuous judgments about locomotion modes with an average accuracy of 96.3% and 94.8% for swing phase and stance phase, respectively (Experiment 1). Furthermore, the system was able to achieve satisfactory recognition performance after the subjects redonned the socket (Experiment 2). We also validated that C-Sens was robust to load bearing changes when amputees carried 5-kg weights during activities (Experiment 3). These results suggest that noncontact capacitive sensing is capable of circumventing practical problems of EMG systems without sacrificing performance and it is, thus, promising for automatic recognition of human motion intent for controlling powered prostheses.","10.1109/TBME.2014.2334316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6847122&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847122","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9294","6847122","Capacitive sensors|Electromyography|Motion detection|Prosthetics|Wearable sensors","biomechanics|biomedical telemetry|body sensor networks|capacitive sensors|electromyography|feature extraction|feature selection|medical control systems|medical signal detection|medical signal processing|prosthetics|quadratic programming|signal classification|skin|telemedicine","","1"

When the grid voltage sags below 80% of nominal, undervoltage protection is likely to disconnect the charging load from the grid. Most PEV charging will occur overnight, when non-PEV load is at a minimum. This paper argues that PEV voltage-sag response, when synchronized across large numbers of PEVs, could result in the loss of a significant proportion of the total load. It is shown that this load loss can lead to unacceptably high voltages once the initiating event has been cleared. This paper explores the nature of this voltage-rise phenomenon. Analysis tools are developed to assist in determining PEV loading conditions that demarcate acceptable postdisturbance voltage response from unacceptable outcomes. Two examples, based on standard distribution test systems, are used to illustrate PEV-induced overvoltage behavior, and demonstrate applications of the analysis tools.","10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2311112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798774&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798774","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0885-8977","6798774","Capacitors|Load modeling|Loading|Mathematical model|Standards|Surges|Voltage fluctuations","electric vehicles|overvoltage protection|power grids|power supply quality","","1"

Such patients are well suited to having their physiological condition monitored using low-power, minimally intrusive wearable sensors. Despite data-collection systems now being manufactured commercially, allowing physiological data to be acquired from mobile patients, little work has been undertaken on the use of the resultant data in a principled manner for robust patient care, including predictive monitoring. Most current devices generate so many false-positive alerts that devices cannot be used for routine clinical practice. This paper explores principled machine learning approaches to interpreting large quantities of continuously acquired, multivariate physiological data, using wearable patient monitors, where the goal is to provide early warning of serious physiological determination, such that a degree of predictive care may be provided. We adopt a one-class support vector machine formulation, proposing a formulation for determining the free parameters of the model using partial area under the ROC curve, a method arising from the unique requirements of performing online analysis with data from patient-worn sensors. There are few clinical evaluations of machine learning techniques in the literature, so we present results from a study at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust devised to investigate the large-scale clinical use of patient-worn sensors for predictive monitoring in a ward with a high incidence of patient mortality. We show that our system can combine routine manual observations made by clinical staff with the continuous data acquired from wearable sensors.

This path of technological evolution has naturally led to a critical issue that has only started to be addressed recently: the resistance of this rapidly emerging technology to external attacks and, in particular, to spoofing. Spoofing, referred to by the term presentation attack in current standards, is a purely biometric vulnerability that is not shared with other IT security solutions. It refers to the ability to fool a biometric system into recognizing an illegitimate user as a genuine one by means of presenting a synthetic forged version of the original biometric trait to the sensor. The entire biometric community, including researchers, developers, standardizing bodies, and vendors, has thrown itself into the challenging task of proposing and developing efficient protection methods against this threat.

We extend the state of the art in two key aspects: (i) A full-conjugate probabilistic formulation of the kernelized matrix factorization enables an efficient variational approximation, whereas full-Bayesian treatments are not computationally feasible in the earlier approaches. (ii) Multiple side information sources are included, treated as different kernels in multiple kernel learning which additionally reveals which side sources are informative.

Although many recommendation systems about regular taxicab services have been proposed recently, little research, if any, has been done to assist passengers to find a successful taxicab ride with carpooling. In this paper, we present the first systematic work to design a unified recommendation system for both the regular and carpooling services, called CallCab, based on a data-driven approach. In response to a passenger's real-time request, CallCab aims to recommend either: 1) a vacant taxicab for a regular service with no detour or 2) an occupied taxicab heading to the similar direction for a carpooling service with the minimum detour, yet without assuming any knowledge of destinations of passengers already in taxicabs. To analyze these unknown destinations of occupied taxicabs, CallCab generates and refines taxicab trip distributions based on GPS data sets and context information collected in the existing taxicab infrastructure. To improve CallCab's efficiency to process such a big data set, we augment the efficient MapReduce model with a Measure phase tailored for our CallCab. Finally, we design a reciprocal price mechanism to facilitate the taxicab carpooling implementation in the real world. We evaluate CallCab with a real-world data set of 14000 taxicabs, and results show that compared with the ground truth, CallCab reduces 60% of the total mileage to deliver all passengers and 41% of passenger's waiting time. Our price mechanism reduces 23% of passengers' fares and increases 28% of drivers' profits simultaneously.","10.1109/TETC.2014.2356493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6894613&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6894613","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-6750","6894613","Cities and towns|Dispatching|Global Positioning System|Public transportation|Real-time systems|Transportation|Urban areas","recommender systems|traffic engineering computing|ubiquitous computing","","1"

Our approach combines two computer vision techniques-shape-based fall characterization and a learning-based classifier to distinguish falls from other daily actions. Given a fall video clip, we extract curvature scale space (CSS) features of human silhouettes at each frame and represent the action by a bag of CSS words (BoCSS). Then, we utilize the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier to identify the BoCSS representation of a fall from those of other actions. In order to eliminate the sensitivity of ELM to its hyperparameters, we present a variable-length particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the number of hidden neurons, corresponding input weights, and biases of ELM. Using a low-cost Kinect depth camera, we build an action dataset that consists of six types of actions (falling, bending, sitting, squatting, walking, and lying) from ten subjects. Experimenting with the dataset shows that our approach can achieve up to 91.15% sensitivity, 77.14% specificity, and 86.83% accuracy.

This paper surveys measurements and capacity studies to assess this technology with a focus on small cell deployments in urban environments. The conclusions are extremely encouraging; measurements in New York City at 28 and 73 GHz demonstrate that, even in an urban canyon environment, significant non-line-of-sight (NLOS) outdoor, street-level coverage is possible up to approximately 200 m from a potential low-power microcell or picocell base station. In addition, based on statistical channel models from these measurements, it is shown that mmW systems can offer more than an order of magnitude increase in capacity over current state-of-the-art 4G cellular networks at current cell densities. Cellular systems, however, will need to be significantly redesigned to fully achieve these gains. Specifically, the requirement of highly directional and adaptive transmissions, directional isolation between links, and significant possibilities of outage have strong implications on multiple access, channel structure, synchronization, and receiver design.

Therefore, real-time scheduling becomes essential to increase the throughput of many-task computing. The difficulty lies in obtaining a series of optimal yet responsive schedules. In dynamic scenarios, such as virtual clusters in cloud, scheduling must be processed fast enough to keep pace with the unpredictable fluctuations in the workloads to optimize the overall system performance. In this paper, ordinal optimization using rough models and fast simulation is introduced to obtain suboptimal solutions in a much shorter timeframe. While the scheduling solution for each period may not be the best, ordinal optimization can be processed fast in an iterative and evolutionary way to capture the details of big-data workload dynamism. Experimental results show that our evolutionary approach compared with existing methods, such as Monte Carlo and Blind Pick, can achieve higher overall average scheduling performance, such as throughput, in real-world applications with dynamic workloads. Furthermore, performance improvement is seen by implementing an optimal computing budget allocating method that smartly allocates computing cycles to the most promising schedules.","10.1109/TETC.2014.2348196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6879452&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6879452","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-6750","6879452","Dynamic scheduling|Monte Carlo methods|Optimization|Processor scheduling|Schedules|Throughput","Big Data|Monte Carlo methods|cloud computing|evolutionary computation|iterative methods|optimisation|scheduling","","1"

A general trend in these medical devices is toward increased functional complexity, software programmability, and connectivity to body area networks (BANs). However, as IWMDs become more &#x201C;intelligent,&#x201D; they also become less trustworthy-less reliable and more prone to attacks. Various shortcomings-hardware failures, software errors, wireless attacks, malware and software exploits, and side-channel attacks-could undermine the trustworthiness of IWMDs and BANs. While these concerns have been recognized for some time, recent demonstrations of security attacks on commercial products, e.g., pacemakers and insulin pumps, have elevated medical device security from the realm of theoretical possibility to an immediate concern. The trustworthiness of IWMDs must be addressed aggressively and proactively due to the potential for catastrophic consequences. Conventional fault tolerance and information security solutions, e.g., redundancy and cryptography, that have been employed in general-purpose and embedded computing systems cannot be applied to many IWMDs due to their extreme size and power constraints and unique usage models. While several recent efforts address defense of IWMDs against specific security attacks, a holistic strategy that considers all concerns and types of threats is required. This paper discusses trustworthiness concerns in IWMDs and BANs through a comprehensive identification and analysis of potential threats and, for each threat, provides a discussion of the merits and inadequacies of current solutions.","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2322103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6827202&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827202","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9219","6827202","Biomedical monitoring|Body area networks|Integrated circuit modeling|Medical diagnostic imaging|Medical services|Security|Software engineering","biomedical telemetry|body area networks|health care|telecommunication security","","1"

In this paper, we investigate the realizability of the b+dRSCT set through two single shift register canonical forms (SSRCFs), called, in the theory of linear systems, constructibility, and controllability. The two investigated SSRCF are the adaptations, for the implementation of b+dRSCT, of the better-known canonical forms controller (constructibility) and observer (controllability). Constructibility is the implementation form actually used for convolutional transducers in TCs. This paper shows that any b+1RSCT can be implemented in a unique SSRCF observer. As a result, we build a function, &#x03BE;:H &#x2192; G, which has as definition domain the set of encoders in SSRCF constructibility, denoted by H, and as codomain a subset of encoders in SSRCF observer, denoted by G. By proving the noninjectivity and nonsurjectivity properties of the function &#x03BE;, we prove that H is redundant and incomplete in comparison with G, i.e., the SSRCF observer is more efficient than the SSRCF constructibility for the implementation of b+1RSCT. We show that the redundancy of the set H is dependent on the memory m and on the number of inputs b of the considered b+1RSCT. In addition, the difference between G and &#x03BE;(H) contains encoders with very good performance, when used in a TC structure. This difference is consistent for m &#x2248; b &gt; 1. The results on the realizability of the b+1RSCT allowed us some considerations on b+dRSCT, with b, d &gt; 1, as well, for which we proposed the SSRCF controllability. These results could be useful in the design of TC based on exhaustive search. So, the proposed implementation form permits the design of new TCs, which cannot be conceived based on the actual form. It is possible, even probable, among these new TCs to find better performance than in the current communication standards- such as LTE, DVB, or deep-space communications.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2316413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6802341&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6802341","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6802341","Complexity theory|Convolutional codes|Decoding|Encoding|Polynomials|Systematics|Transducers","controllability|convolutional codes|feedback|linear systems|matrix algebra|observers|polynomials|shift registers|transducers|turbo codes","","1"

However, it is difficult to treat friction models with equations because the level of precision that is associated with real friction characteristics and parameter tuning are difficult to achieve. In contrast, repetitive perfect tracking control (RPTC) is a repetitive control technique that achieves high-precision positioning. In this paper, we propose the use of RPTC with n-times learning filter. The n-times learning filter has a sharper rolloff property than conventional learning filters. With the use of the n-times learning filter, the proposed RPTC can converge tracking errors n times faster than the RPTC with the conventional learning filter. Simulations and experiments with a ball-screw-driven stage show the fast convergence of the proposed RPTC. Finally, the proposed learning control scheme is combined with data-based friction compensation, and the effectiveness of this combination is verified for the x-y stage of a numerically controlled machine tool.","10.1109/TIE.2013.2290286","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661341&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661341","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0278-0046","6661341","","adaptive control|ball screws|control system synthesis|friction|learning systems|position control","","1"

The system is simulated and evaluated following the prescriptions of the NEMA NU 2-2001 and the NEMA NU 4-2008 standards. Results show that the excellent energy resolution of the CdTe detectors (1.6% for 511 keV photons), together with the small voxel pitch (1 &#x00D7; 1 &#x00D7; 2 mm<sup>3</sup>), and the crack-free ring geometry, give the design the potential to overcome the current limitations of PET scanners and to approach the intrinsic image resolution limits set by physics. The VIP is expected to reach a competitive sensitivity and a superior signal purity with respect to values commonly quoted for state-of-the-art scintillating crystal PETs. The system can provide 14 cps/kBq with a scatter fraction of 3.95% and 21 cps/kBq with a scatter fraction of 0.73% according to NEMA NU 2-2001 and NEMA NU 4-2008, respectively. The calculated NEC curve has a peak value of 122 kcps at 5.3 kBq/mL for NEMA NU 2-2001 and 908 kcps at 1.6 MBq/mL for NEMA NU 4-2008. The proposed scanner can achieve an image resolution of ~ 1 mm full-width at half-maximum in all directions. The virtually noise-free data sample leads to direct positive impact on the quality of the reconstructed images. As a consequence, high-quality high-resolution images can be obtained with significantly lower number of events compared to conventional scanners. Overall, simulation results suggest the VIP scanner can be operated either at normal dose for fast scanning and high patient throughput, or at low dose to decrease the patient radioactivity exposure.

In the MIXSEL, the semiconductor saturable absorber of a SESAM is integrated into the structure of a VECSEL to start and stabilize passive mode-locking. In comparison to previous noise characterization of SESAM-mode-locked VECSELs, this first noise characterization of a MIXSEL is performed at a much higher average output power. In a free-running operation, the laser generates 14.3-ps pulses at an average output power of 645 mW at a 2-GHz pulse repetition rate and an RMS amplitude noise of 0.15% [1 Hz, 10 MHz]. We measured an RMS timing jitter of 129 fs [100 Hz, 10 MHz], which represents the lowest value for a free-running passively mode-locked semiconductor disk laser to date. Additionally, we stabilized the pulse repetition rate with a piezo actuator to control the cavity length. With the laser generating 16.7-ps pulses at an average output power of 701 mW, the repetition frequency was phase-locked to a low-noise electronic reference using a feedback loop. In actively stabilized operation, the RMS timing jitter was reduced to less than 70 fs [1 Hz, 100 MHz]. In the 100-Hz to 10-MHz bandwidth, we report the lowest timing jitter measured from a passively mode-locked semiconductor disk laser to date with a value of 31 fs. These results show that the MIXSEL technology provides compact ultrafast laser sources combining high-power and low-noise performance similar to diode-pumped solid-state lasers, which enable world-record optical communication rates and low-noise frequency combs.","10.1109/JPHOT.2013.2295464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6690115&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690115","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6690115","Cavity resonators|Laser mode locking|Laser noise|Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers","integrated optoelectronics|laser beams|laser cavity resonators|laser feedback|laser mode locking|laser noise|laser stability|optical pulse generation|optical saturable absorption|piezoelectric actuators|semiconductor lasers|surface emitting lasers|timing jitter","","1"

The internal resonant modes have recently been studied by the authors; this letter investigates the static loop modes. Like internal resonant modes, static loop modes, in theory, should not be observed in the MOT solution since they do not satisfy the zero initial conditions; their appearance is attributed to numerical errors. It is discussed in this letter that the dependence of spurious static loop modes on numerical errors is substantially different from that of spurious internal resonant modes. More specifically, when Rao-Wilton-Glisson functions and Lagrange interpolation functions are used as spatial and temporal basis functions, respectively, errors due to space-time discretization have no discernible impact on spurious static loop modes. Numerical experiments indeed support this discussion and demonstrate that the numerical errors due to the approximate solution of the MOT matrix system have dominant impact on spurious static loop modes in the MOT solution.","10.1109/LAWP.2014.2305716","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6737267&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6737267","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1536-1225","6737267","Antennas|Electric fields|Integral equations|Interpolation|Matrix decomposition|Null space|Time-domain analysis","electric field integral equations|interpolation|matrix algebra|time-domain analysis","","1"

Fully understanding the consequences of an administrative policy in an enterprise system can be difficult, because of the scale and complexity of the access control policy and the administrative policy, and because sequences of changes by different users may interact in unexpected ways. Administrative policy analysis helps by answering questions such as user-permission reachability, which asks whether specified users can together change the policy in a way that achieves a specified goal, namely, granting a specified permission to a specified user. This paper presents a rule-based access control policy language, a rule-based administrative policy model that controls addition and removal of facts and rules, and an abductive analysis algorithm for user-permission reachability. Abductive analysis means that the algorithm can analyze policy rules even if the facts initially in the policy (e.g., information about users) are unavailable. The algorithm does this by computing minimal sets of facts that, if present in the initial policy, imply reachability of the goal.","10.1109/TDSC.2013.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6616529&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616529","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1545-5971","6616529","Access control|Algorithm design and analysis|Grammar|Hospitals|Organizations|Semantics","DP management|authorisation","",""

Using probit regression as an illustrative working example, this paper presents a general and effective methodology based on the pseudo-marginal approach to Markov chain Monte Carlo that efficiently addresses both of these issues. The results presented in this paper show improvements over existing sampling methods to simulate from the posterior distribution over the parameters defining the covariance function of the Gaussian Process prior.

Speaker identification (SID) performance, in particular, degrades rapidly as reverberation time increases. Reverberation causes two forms of spectro-temporal distortions on speech signals: i) self-masking which is due to early reflections and ii) overlap-masking which is due to late reverberation. Overlap-masking effect of reverberation has been shown to have a greater adverse impact on performance of speech systems. Motivated by this fact, this study proposes a blind spectral weighting (BSW) technique for suppressing the reverberation overlap-masking effect on SID systems. The technique is blind in the sense that prior knowledge of neither the anechoic signal nor the room impulse response is required. Performance of the proposed technique is evaluated on speaker verification tasks under simulated and actual reverberant mismatched conditions. Evaluations are conducted in the context of the conventional GMM-UBM as well as the state-of-the-art i-vector based systems. The GMM-UBM experiments are performed using speech material from a new data corpus well suited for speaker verification experiments under actual reverberant mismatched conditions, entitled MultiRoom8. The i-vector experiments are carried out with microphone (interview and phonecall) data from the NIST SRE 2010 extended evaluation set which are digitally convolved with three different measured room impulse responses extracted from the Aachen impulse response (AIR) database. Experimental results prove that incorporating the proposed blind technique into the standard MFCC feature extraction framework yields significant improvement in SID performance under reverberation mismatch.","10.1109/TASLP.2014.2311329","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762999&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6762999","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2329-9290","6762999","Estimation|Licenses|Microphones|Reverberation|Speech|Speech enhancement","anechoic chambers (acoustic)|feature extraction|reverberation|speaker recognition|speech intelligibility","","1"

A bicluster-based BPCA (bi-BPCA) method is proposed in this paper to fully exploit local structure of the matrix. In a bicluster, the most correlated genes and experimental conditions with the missing entry are identified, and BPCA is conducted on these biclusters to estimate the missing values.

Furthermore, we combine the newly proposed MinMin algorithm with MaxMin as well as Sufferage, obtaining two hybrid algorithms. The motivation behind the former hybrid algorithm is to address the drawback of MaxMin in solving problem instances with highly skewed cost distributions while also improving the running time performance of MaxMin. The latter hybrid algorithm improves the running time performance of Sufferage without degrading its solution quality. The proposed algorithms are easy to implement and we illustrate them through detailed pseudocodes.

The potential to integrate optics with electronics and mechanics is a great advantage in biomedical instrumentation, where the integration of miniaturized optical detection systems with microfluidics enables smaller, faster, more-functional, and cheaper systems. The precise dimensions and alignment of MEMS devices, combined with the mechanical stability that comes with miniaturization, make optical MEMS sensors well suited to a variety of challenging measurements. Micro-optical systems also benefit from the addition of nanostructures to the MEMS toolbox. Photonic crystals and microcavities, which represent the ultimate in miniaturized optical components, enable further scaling of optical MEMS.","10.1109/JMEMS.2014.2319266","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6817527&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6817527","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1057-7157","6817527","Biomedical optical imaging|Lenses|Micromechanical devices|Optical device fabrication|Optical sensors|Silicon","beam steering|bioMEMS|biomedical equipment|diffractive optical elements|electrostatic actuators|integrated optics|integrated optoelectronics|lenses|magnetic actuators|micro-optomechanical devices|microcavities|microfluidics|micromachining|micromirrors|microsensors|nanophotonics|optical fabrication|optical fibre filters|optical sensors|optical switches|photonic crystals|pneumatic actuators","","1"

Under network coding, a node may need to buffer a sent packet for decoding a packet to be received later. If sent packets are not forgotten smartly, much buffer space will be taken up, leading to dropping of new incoming packets. This unexpected packet dropping harms the final throughput obtained, although optimal scheduling has been used. To solve the problem, we introduce a new node model incorporating a transmission-mode preassignment procedure and a scheduling procedure. The introduced transmission-mode preassignment avoids memorizing several sent packets to reduce buffer overhead. We develop a new scheduling policy based on our node model and analyze formally the stability property of a network system using the proposed policy.

Several parameters are used to discriminate the snow-covered areas from nonsnow-covered areas in the Indian Himalayan region, including backscattering coefficients, the ratio of cross/copolarized backscattering power and polarization fraction (PF) value. Supervised classification schemes are employed using polarimetric decomposition methods based on the complex Wishart classifier. The accuracy of the classification was found to be 97.95% for the Wishart-supervised classification. Among various parameters and methods, it was found that the alternative newly proposed PF scheme, based on the implementation of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data, yielded the best classification result in the absence of the training samples. The PF value has been effective for discrimination of the snow-covered areas from nonsnow-covered areas, debris-covered glacier, and vegetation.

A method to suppress the crosstalk and hence expand the buffering capacity is proposed by inserting variable optical attenuators (VOAs) between successive MZI switches.

The cornerstone of our approach is an innovation model that is driven by some generalized white noise process, which may be Gaussian or not (e.g., Laplace, impulsive Poisson, or alpha stable). This allows for a conceptual decoupling between the correlation properties of the process, which are imposed by the whitening operator L, and its sparsity pattern, which is determined by the type of noise excitation. The latter is fully specified by a Le&#x0301;vy measure. We show that the range of admissible innovation behavior varies between the purely Gaussian and super-sparse extremes. We prove that the corresponding generalized stochastic processes are well-defined mathematically provided that the (adjoint) inverse of the whitening operator satisfies some Lp bound for p &#x2265; 1. We present a novel operator-based method that yields an explicit characterization of all Le&#x0301;vy-driven processes that are solutions of constant-coefficient stochastic differential equations. When the underlying system is stable, we recover the family of stationary continuous-time autoregressive moving average processes (CARMA), including the Gaussian ones. The approach remains valid when the system is unstable and leads to the identification of potentially useful generalizations of the Le&#x0301;vy processes, which are sparse and non-stationary. Finally, we show that these processes admit a sparse representation in some matched wavelet domain and provide a full characterization of their transform-domain statistics.","10.1109/TIT.2014.2298453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704775&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6704775","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9448","6704775","Discrete cosine transforms|Mathematical model|Stochastic processes|Technological innovation|Wavelet transforms|White noise","Gaussian processes|signal processing|stochastic processes","","1"

However, one critical challenge to WSNs implementation is source location privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based diversionary routing scheme for preserving source location privacy using hide and seek strategy to create diversionary or decoy routes along the path to the sink from the real source, where the end of each diversionary route is a decoy (fake source node), which periodically emits fake events. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme is able to maximize the network lifetime of WSNs. The main idea is that the lifetime of WSNs depends on the nodes with high energy consumption or hotspot, and then the proposed scheme minimizes energy consumption in hotspot and creates redundancy diversionary routes in nonhotspot regions with abundant energy. Hence, it achieves not only privacy preservation, but also network lifetime maximization. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the energy consumption in WSNs, and provide guidance on the number of diversionary routes, which can be created in different regions away from the sink. In addition, we identify a novel attack against phantom routing, which is widely used for source location privacy preservation, namely, direction-oriented attack. We also perform a comprehensive analysis on how the direction-oriented attack can be defeated by the proposed scheme. Theoretical and experimental results show that our scheme is very effective to improve the privacy protection while maximizing the network lifetime.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2332817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6842655&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6842655","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6842655","Energy consumption|Position measurement|Privacy|Routing protocols|Source location|Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing|telecommunication security|trees (mathematics)|wireless sensor networks","","1"

MCTS is used to find an optimal path for an agent at each turn, determining the move to make based on the results of numerous randomized simulations. Several enhancements are introduced in order to adapt MCTS to the real-time domain. Ms Pac-Man is an arcade game, in which the protagonist has several goals but no conclusive terminal state. Unlike games such as Chess or Go there is no state in which the player wins the game. Instead, the game has two subgoals, 1) surviving and 2) scoring as many points as possible. Decisions must be made in a strict time constraint of 40 ms. The Pac-Man agent has to compete with a range of different ghost teams, hence limited assumptions can be made about their behavior. In order to expand the capabilities of existing MCTS agents, four enhancements are discussed: 1) a variable-depth tree; 2) simulation strategies for the ghost team and Pac-Man; 3) including long-term goals in scoring; and 4) reusing the search tree for several moves with a decay factor &#x03B3;.

A mechanical resonance at the very high frequency of 100 MHz is detected in the drain current of the highly doped silicon wire with a cross-section down to ~ 30 nm. We show that the depletion charge modulation provides a ~ 35 dB increase in output signal-to-noise compared to the second-order piezoresistive detection, which can be separately investigated within the same device. The proposed junctionless resonator stands, therefore, as a unique and valuable tool for comparing the field effect and the piezoresistive modulation efficiency in the same structure, depending on size and doping.

Technically, this is done by evaluating remote measurements of the transferred, chirped frequency. The gates of the frequency counters, here driven by a 10-MHz oscillation derived from a hydrogen maser, play a role analogous to the 1-pulse per second (PPS) signals usually employed for time transfer. In general, for time transfer, the gates consequently must be related to the external clock. Synchronizing observations based on frequency measurements, on the other hand, only requires a stable oscillator driving the frequency counters. In a proof of principle, we demonstrate the suppression of symmetrical delays, such as the geometrical path delay. We transfer an optical frequency chirped by around 240 kHz/s over a fiber link of around 149 km. We observe an accuracy and simultaneity, as well as a precision (Allan deviation, 18 000 s averaging interval) of the transferred frequency of around 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-19</sup>. We apply chirped frequency transfer to remote measurements of the synchronization between two counters' gate intervals. Here, we find a precision of around 200 ps at an estimated overall uncertainty of around 500 ps. The measurement results agree with those obtained from reference measurements, being well within the uncertainty. In the present setup, timing offsets up to 4 min can be measured unambiguously.

To enhance the sparsity constraint for better imaging performance, a promising direction is to use the &#x2113;<sub>p</sub> norm (0 &lt;; p &lt;; 1) and solve the &#x2113;<sub>p</sub> minimization problem. Very recently, Xu et al. developed an analytic solution for the &#x2113;<sub>1/2</sub> regularization via an iterative thresholding operation, which is also referred to as half-threshold filtering. In this paper, we design a simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART)-type half-threshold filtering framework to solve the computed tomography (CT) reconstruction problem. In the medical imaging filed, the discrete gradient transform (DGT) is widely used to define the sparsity. However, the DGT is noninvertible and it cannot be applied to half-threshold filtering for CT reconstruction. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed SART-type half-threshold filtering framework, an emphasis of this paper is to construct a pseudoinverse transforms for DGT. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with numerical and physical phantom data sets. Our results show that the SART-type half-threshold filtering algorithms have great potential to improve the reconstructed image quality from few and noisy projections. They are complementary to the counterparts of the state-of-the-art soft-threshold filtering and hard-threshold filtering.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2326165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6819396&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819396","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6819396","Biomedical measurement|Computed tomography|Filtering|Image reconstruction|Minization|Noise measurement|Threshold analysis|Transforms","algebra|computerised tomography|filtering theory|image enhancement|image reconstruction|image segmentation|inverse transforms|iterative methods|medical image processing|minimisation","","1"

The switch is based on the injection-locking property of a single-mode Fabry-Pe&#x0301;rot laser diode (SMFP-LD). Unlike the case of full-lock (FL) in which self-locked mode and all side modes of the SMFP-LD are fully suppressed due to high injected input power, in the WL case, the injection power is gradually decreased as if the SMFP-LD's self-locked mode is still maintained. It was observed that the output waveform's rising edge, taken at the self-locked mode's wavelength after the filter, in the WL case is clean at speed of 12 Gb/s compared to the blur and noisy rising edge in the FL case even at much lower speed (1 Gb/s). In summary, the WL technique shows advantages compared to the conventional FL technique in terms of lower injection power and higher on/off switching speed.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2331257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6838968&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838968","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6838968","High-speed optical techniques|Laser beams|Logic gates|Measurement by laser beam|Optical switches|Optical wavelength conversion","laser modes|optical switches|semiconductor lasers","","1"

The resolution of a conventional delay chain TDC is limited by the delay of a logic buffer.

To address these issues, we propose a simple method to break the resolution limitation without any calibration: a G<sub>m</sub>-C integrator followed by a successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR-ADC). This translates the time interval into charge, and then the charge is quantized. A prototype chip was fabricated in 90 nm CMOS. The measurement results reveal a 1 ps resolution, a -0.6/0.7 LSB differential nonlinearity (DNL), a -1.1/2.3 LSB integral nonlinearity (INL), and a 9-bit range. The measured 11.74 ps single-shot precision is caused by the noise of the integrator. We analyze the noise of the integrator and propose an improved front-end circuit to reduce this noise.

The proposed dual-gain APS employs the conversion gain control in a pixel sensor array and supports both high and low sensitivity modes for FPXD. The in-pixel conversion gain control suppresses the amplification of the pixel noise, so it improves signal-to-noise characteristics. The column-parallel readout circuits include single-slope analog-to-digital converters (SS-ADCs) and charge-summing circuits for pixel binning and analog double delta sampling (DDS). SS-ADCs support 12-bit resolution and use the driving method of gray-code counters with different initial values to reduce the peak current and the power fluctuation.

Determining the best time to buy or sell stocks in a stock market, and thereby maximizing profit with low risks, is an important issue in financial research. Recent studies have used trading rules based on technique analysis to address this problem. This method can determine trading times by analyzing the value of technical indicators. In other words, we can make trading rules by finding the trading value of technique indicators. An example of a trading rule would be, if one technical indicator's value achieves the setting value, then either buy or sell. A combination of trading rules would become a trading strategy. The process of making trading strategies can be formulated as a combinational optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method for applying a trading system. First, the proposed method uses the quantum-inspired Tabu search algorithm to find the optimal composition and combination of trading strategies. Second, this method uses a sliding window to avoid the major problem of over-fitting. The experiment results of earning money show much better performance than other approaches, and the proposed method outperforms the buy and hold method (which is a benchmark in this field).","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2352261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6883114&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883114","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6883114","Decision making|Encoding|Evolutionary computation|Genetic algorithms|Heuristic algorithms|Information analysis|Information retrieval|Search methods|Stock markets|Training","combinatorial mathematics|decision making|econophysics|evolutionary computation|search problems|stock markets","","1"

Surface roughness values are derived from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud collected in 2004 from a fixed-wing airborne platform. Patterns in surface roughness are characterized using co-occurrence texture statistics. Pristine-pyroclastic, reworked-pyroclastic, mudflow, boulder beds, eroded lava flows, braided streams, and other units within the Pumice Plain are all found to have significantly distinct roughness textures. The MSH deposits are reasonably accessible, and the textural variations have been verified in the field. Results of this work indicate that by affecting the distribution of large clasts and tens-of-meter scale landforms, modification of pyroclastic deposits by lahars alters the morphology of the surface in detectable quantifiable ways. When a lahar erodes a pyroclastic deposit, surface roughness increases, as does the randomness in the deposit surface. Conversely, when a lahar deposits material, the resulting landforms are less rough but more random than pristine pumice-rich pyroclastic deposits. By mapping these relationships and others, volcanic deposit facies can be differentiated. This new method of mapping, based on roughness texture, has the potential to aid mapping efforts in more remote regions, both on this planet and elsewhere in the solar system.","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2241443","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6476666&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6476666","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0196-2892","6476666","Laser radar|Rough surfaces|Surface morphology|Surface roughness|Surface texture|Surface topography|Surface treatment","optical radar|remote sensing by laser beam|rocks|statistical analysis|terrain mapping|volcanology","","1"

The unpredictable synchronization error leads to time domain offset and signal arriving order (SAO) ambiguity when two signals sent from two sources are superimposed at the relay. A two-step channel estimation algorithm is first proposed, in which the linear minimum mean-square-error (LMMSE) estimator is used to obtain initial channel estimates based on pilot symbols and a linear minimum error probability (LMEP) estimator is then developed to update these estimates. Optimal training sequences and power allocation at the relay are designed to further improve the performance for LMMSE based initial channel estimation. To tackle the SAO ambiguity problem, the generalized likelihood ratio testing method is applied and an upper bound on the SAO detection error probability is derived. By using the SAO information, a scaled LMEP estimation algorithm is proposed to compensate for the performance degradation caused by SAO detection error. Simulation results show that the proposed estimation algorithms can effectively mitigate the negative effects caused by asynchronous transmissions in TWRNs, thus significantly outperforming the existing channel estimation algorithms.","10.1109/TSP.2014.2360146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6907998&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6907998","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1053-587X","6907998","Channel estimation|Estimation|Relays|Signal processing algorithms|Silicon|Synchronization|Training","channel estimation|error detection|error statistics|least mean squares methods|relay networks (telecommunication)|synchronisation|wireless channels","","1"

With boundary conditions used, a matrix equation with a dimension of (N+1) by (N+1), where N is the number of terms for truncated series, is obtained, which can be easily solved by using the Newton-Raphson root-shooting algorithm.

Datasets of 30 refractory epileptic patients were used to assess the new method. Each set consisted of structural images (MRI and CT) and functional studies (SPECT and PET), thereby allowing the inclusion of anatomical and functional variability in the simulation input models. SPECT and PET sinograms were obtained using the SimSET package and were reconstructed with the same protocols as those employed for the clinical studies. The convergence of Brain-VISET was evaluated by studying the behavior throughout iterations of the correlation coefficient, the quotient image histogram and a ROI analysis comparing simulated with real studies.

Two comparative controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of TeamWATCH. The experimental results showed that the subjects using TeamWATCH spent less time than subjects using the command-line subversion client and TortoiseSVN in answering the same set of questions regarding source code revision history.

The calculations were carried out in the range of the first radial resonance frequency of the sensor. At the resonance, the hyperelastic effect of the silicone rubber was modeled by a hyperelastic compensating function. The calculated response was matched to the measured response by using the transitional peaks in the impedance spectrum that originates from the switching of standing Lamb wave modes in the silicone rubber. To validate the results, the impedance responses of three 5-mm-thick silicone rubber disks, with different radial lengths, were measured.

These toroids include sufficient ions to neutralize the space charge of the electrons. This model leads to the name Electron Spiral Toroid Spheromak (ESTS). The discovery of this new class of spheromaks resulted from work to explain ball lightning. A comparison is made between the experimental observations of spheromaks in partial atmosphere and reported ball lightning observations; strong similarities are reported. The ESTS is also found to have a high ion density of ~ 10<sup>19</sup> ions/cm<sup>3</sup> without needing any external toroidal magnetic field for containment, compared, for example, to tokamaks, with ion density limits of ~ 10<sup>15</sup> ions/cm<sup>3</sup>. This high ion density is a defining characteristic and opens the potential to be useful in applications. The ESTS is a field reversed configuration plasma toroid.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2308476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748850&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6748850","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6748850","Atmospheric modeling|Ball lightning|Ions|Lightning|Plasmas|Toroidal magnetic fields","ion density|lightning|plasma density|reversed field pinch","","1"

In this paper, we investigate the energy efficiency of three basic bidirectional relay transmission schemes [i.e., the four time-slot (4TS), three time-slot (3TS), and two time-slot (2TS) schemes] from the angle of relay deployment. Since a realistic power consumption model is very important in analyzing energy efficiency, and a power amplifier (PA) consumes up to 70% of the total power, we consider a realistic nonideal PA model. The derived closed-form expressions for the optimal relay deployment and the simulation results reveal the following important conclusions. First, it is possible to achieve the optimal energy efficiency and enlarge the cell coverage simultaneously in bad channel conditions, but it may be very challenging in good channel conditions. Second, under asymmetric traffic conditions, particularly when the downlink rate is larger than the uplink rate, all the aforementioned three schemes have almost the same optimal relay deployment, but the 2TS scheme has the highest energy efficiency when the spectral efficiency is large. Third, the relay node should be deployed closer to the base station with the nonideal PA than that with the ideal PA, and the optimal energy efficiency with the nonideal PA is much higher than that with the ideal PA. Moreover, the impact of small-scale fading depends on the value of path loss. To overcome the small-scale fading, the relay network needs to consume more energy.","10.1109/TVT.2013.2295413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689323&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6689323","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9545","6689323","Downlink|Energy consumption|Fading|Licenses|Power demand|Relays|Uplink","fading channels|power amplifiers|radio networks|relay networks (telecommunication)|telecommunication power management|telecommunication traffic","","1"

Current developments in PHY security are often based on the assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper, both security and reliability performance for the downlink cloud radio access network with optimal remote radio heads (RRHs) node selection are investigated in a practical scenario by considering channel estimation (CE) errors. In particular, a three-phase transmission scheme is proposed and the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation method is utilized to obtain the CSI. Based on the CSI estimates and the statistics of CE errors, the outage probability and intercept probability are derived in closed-form expression to evaluate the security and reliability performance, respectively. In addition, two possible cases (with or without intercepting signals from baseband unit) are considered for the eavesdropper. It is found that the suggested optimal RRHs selection scheme outperforms the nonselection scheme, and that the increasing number of RRHs can lower the outage probability as well as the intercept probability. It is also shown that there exists an optimal training number to minimize the sum of the outage probability and intercept probability.

The PSRR of the prototype CDA is very high, -101 dB @217 Hz and 90 dB @1 kHz, arguably the highest to-date. Furthermore, the switching frequency of the prototype CDA varies from ~320 to 420 kHz, potentially reducing the EMI due to spread-spectrum.

This increases the probability that consecutive recorded instants of expressions represent the same affective content. In this paper, we exploit such a relationship to improve the recognition performance of continuous naturalistic affective expressions. Using datasets of naturalistic affective expressions (AVEC 2011 audio and video dataset, PAINFUL video dataset) continuously labeled over time and over different dimensions, we analyze the transitions between levels of those dimensions (e.g., transitions in pain intensity level). We use an information theory approach to show that the transitions occur very slowly and hence suggest modeling them as first-order Markov models. The dimension levels are considered to be the hidden states in the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. Their discrete transition and emission matrices are trained by using the labels provided with the training set. The recognition problem is converted into a best path-finding problem to obtain the best hidden states sequence in HMMs. This is a key difference from previous use of HMMs as classifiers. Modeling of the transitions between dimension levels is integrated in a multistage approach, where the first level performs a mapping between the affective expression features and a soft decision value (e.g., an affective dimension level), and further classification stages are modeled as HMMs that refine that mapping by taking into account the temporal relationships between the output decision labels. The experimental results for each of the unimodal datasets show overall performance to be significantly above that of a standard classification system that does not take into account temporal relationships. In particular, the results on the AVEC 2011 audio dataset outperform all other systems presented at the international competition.","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2253768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6507321&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6507321","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2267","6507321","","audio signal processing|emotion recognition|face recognition|feature extraction|hidden Markov models|image classification|learning (artificial intelligence)|matrix algebra|speech recognition","","1"

However, maximizing accuracy does not guarantee reliable interpretation as similar accuracies can be obtained from distinct sets of features. In the current paper we propose a new approach for selecting features: SCoRS (survival count on random subsamples) based on a recently proposed Stability Selection theory. SCoRS relies on the idea of choosing relevant features that are stable under data perturbation. Data are perturbed by iteratively sub-sampling both features (subspaces) and examples.

This paper reviews the EPT approach from its basic theory in electromagnetism to the state-of-the-art research outcomes. Emphasizing on the imaging reconstruction methods rather than experimentation techniques, we review the developed imaging algorithms, validation results in physical phantoms and biological tissues, as well as their applications in in vivo tumor detection and subject-specific SAR prediction. Challenges for future research are also discussed.","10.1109/RBME.2013.2297206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701123&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701123","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1937-3333","6701123","Bioimpedance|Biomedical measurement|Image reconstruction|Magnetic field measurement|Magnetic fields|Magnetic resonance imaging|Radio frequency|Specific absorption rate|Tomography","bioelectric phenomena|biomedical MRI|electric impedance imaging|electrical conductivity|image reconstruction|medical image processing|permittivity|phantoms|reviews|tumours","","1"

This interaction depends on the polarization direction of the incident light and the separation distance between the nanoholes. It is found that when the nanoholes are illuminated by a plane wave incident light polarized parallel to the axis of the nanohole pair, the SPP waves can propagate between the nanoholes, and therefore, the nanoholes can interact through SPPs. In contrast, it is shown that for the incident plane wave polarized perpendicular to the pair axis, the propagation direction of the SPPs is normal to the pair axis, and thus, a weak interaction through the SPPs can occur between the nanoholes. It is also shown that in order to investigate the interaction of the nanoholes through the SPP waves, each nanohole can be modeled by a magnetic dipole, which propagates SPPs. Thus, the optical properties of the interacting nanoholes can be modeled using a magnetic-coupled dipole approximation method accounting SPPs to confirm the simulation results.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2326653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6820732&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820732","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6820732","Gold|Magnetic separation|Optical films|Optical polarization|Optical surface waves","gold|light polarisation|metallic thin films|nanophotonics|polaritons|surface plasmons","","1"

The parameters consist of speed multiplier, direction, contrast type and the global velocity scale. In addition, we investigated if multiple motion cues, and point distribution, affect the speed estimation. Several studies were executed to investigate the impact of each parameter. In the initial results, we noticed trends in scale and multiplier. Using the trends for the significant parameters, we designed a compensation model, which adjusts the particle speed to compensate for the effect of the parameters. We then performed a second study to investigate the performance of the compensation model. From the second study we detected a constant estimation error, which we adjusted for in the last study.

In this work, we propose an arbitration to provide equality-of-service (EoS) in the network and provide support for location-oblivious task placement. We propose using probabilistic arbitration combined with distance-based weights to achieve EoS and overcome the limitation of round-robin arbiter. However, the complexity of probabilistic arbitration results in high area and long latency which negatively impacts performance. In order to reduce the hardware complexity, we propose an hybrid arbiter that switches between a simple arbiter at low load and a complex arbiter at high load. The hybrid arbiter is enabled by the observation that arbitration only impacts the overall performance and global fairness at a high load. We evaluate our arbitration scheme with synthetic traffic patterns and GPGPU benchmarks. Our results shows that hybrid arbiter that combines round-robin arbiter with probabilistic distance-based arbitration reduces performance variation as task placement is varied and also improves average IPC.","10.1109/TC.2012.241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6319294&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6319294","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9340","6319294","Bandwidth|Measurement|Probabilistic logic|Program processors|Routing|System-on-a-chip","asynchronous circuits|cache storage|circuit complexity|graphics processing units|multiprocessing systems|network-on-chip|performance evaluation|probability","","1"

In order to avoid an exponential increase of computational complexity in large-scale wireless networks, we model the target optimization problem as a minimum cost-flow problem and find the solution of the problem in polynomial time. For the networks with decentralized management, we propose a distributed algorithm using the distributed energy minimization dynamics of the Hopfield-Tank neural network.

Reflectance spectra were measured from airborne hyperspectral AISA Eagle/Hawk imagery in order to identify different Mediterranean tree species at a coastal test site in Portugal. A spectral range from 400 to 2450 nm was recorded at 2-m spatial resolution. The hyperspectral data are divided into five spectral data ranges. The chosen ranges for segmentation are based on statistical properties as well as on their wavelengths, as radiances of a particular wavelength may overlap with neighboring wavelengths. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied individually to each spectral range. The first three principal components (PCs) of each range are chosen and are fused into a new data segment of reduced dimensionality. The resulting 15 PCs contain 99.42% of the information content of the original hyperspectral image. These PCs were used for a maximum likelihood classification (MLC). Spectral signatures were also analyzed for the hyperspectral data, and were validated with ground data collected in the field by a handheld spectro-radiometer. Different RGB combinations of PC bands of segmented PC image provide distinct feature identification. A comparison with other classification approaches (spectral angle mapper and MLC of the original hyperspectral imagery) shows that the MLC of the segmented PCA achieves the highest accuracy, due to its ability to reduce the Hughes phenomenon.","10.1109/JSEN.2014.2335612","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6848757&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848757","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1530-437X","6848757","Atmospheric modeling|Hyperspectral imaging|Image segmentation|Principal component analysis|Sensors|Vegetation","geophysical image processing|geophysical techniques|hyperspectral imaging|image classification|image segmentation|remote sensing|vegetation","","1"

Although KFs can estimate the translation, the translation error increases in a short period of time when the sensor fails to sense hand movement, including handshaking. Therefore, a method to correct the translation error is required. In this paper, the change rate of the human hand is used to determine the posture of the robot. An overdamping strategy is also employed to eliminate the effect of movement sensing failure. Given that a human operator has difficulty operating with high precision due to perceptive and motor limitations, an AMT method is proposed to assist the operator in improving the accuracy and reliability of determining the movement of the robot. The human-manipulator interface is then experimentally tested in a laboratory environment.

Initial validation of the model is provided by applying a test stimulus to a hardware platform and comparing the measured circuit response to the expected from the behavioural model. Our model is then used to demonstrate the effect of the Analogue Front-End (AFE) on subsequent spike processing by testing established spike detection and sorting methods on a selection of systems reported in the literature. It is revealed that although these designs have a wide variation in design parameters (and thus also circuit complexity), the ultimate impact on spike processing performance is relatively low (10-15%).

In this paper, the heterogeneity of large-scale user behavior is quantitatively characterized and exploited to study the energy efficiency (EE) in HCNs. An optimization problem is formulated for energy-efficient two-tier deployment and configuration, where the base station (BS) density, BS transmit power, BS static power, and quality of service are taken into account. We present closed-form formulas that establish the quantitative relationship between large-scale user behavior and energy-efficient HCN configuration.

The images were collected near the downtown area and include single family houses, skyscrapers, apartment complexes, industrial buildings, roads/highways, urban parks, and bodies of water. Experiments show that atmospheric and geometric properties of the acquisitions substantially affect the pixel values and, more specifically, that the raw counts are significantly correlated to the atmospheric visibility. Results of a 22-class urban land cover experiment show that an improvement of 0.374 in terms of Kappa coefficient can be achieved over the base case of raw pixels when surface reflectance values are combined to the angular decomposition of the time series.","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2295819","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6737293&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6737293","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0196-2892","6737293","Atmospheric measurements|Geometry|Satellites|Scattering|Sensors|Spatial resolution|Time series analysis","geophysical image processing|land cover|terrain mapping","","1"

In this method, a feature signal is obtained by computing the normalized correlation (NC) between the host signal and a random signal. Information modulation is carried out on the generated NC by selecting a codeword from the codebook associated with the embedded information. In a simple case, the structured codebooks are designed using uniform quantizers for modulation. The watermarked signal is produced to provide the modulated NC in the sense of minimizing the embedding distortion. The performance of the NC-based quantization modulation (NCQM) is analytically investigated, in terms of the embedding distortion and the decoding error probability in the presence of valumetric scaling and additive noise attacks. Numerical simulations on artificial signals confirm the validity of our analyses and exhibit the performance advantage of NCQM over other modulation techniques. The proposed method is also simulated on real images by using the wavelet-based implementations, where the host signal is constructed by the detail coefficients of wavelet decomposition at the third level and transformed into the NC feature signal for the information modulation. Experimental results show that the proposed NCQM not only achieves the improved watermark imperceptibility and a higher embedding capacity in high-noise regimes, but also is more robust to a wide range of attacks, e.g., valumetric scaling, Gaussian filtering, additive noise, Gamma correction, and Gray-level transformations, as compared with the state-of-the-art watermarking methods.","10.1109/TMM.2014.2340695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6860239&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6860239","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1520-9210","6860239","Decoding|Feature extraction|Modulation|Quantization (signal)|Robustness|Vectors|Watermarking","AWGN|correlation methods|error statistics|filtering theory|image watermarking|modulation|quantisation (signal)|wavelet transforms","","1"

An iterative relaxation algorithm is employed to adapt the information extracted from the images to a finite-element model of the stent, and the radial components of the interaction forces between the stent and the tissue are extracted. For the evaluation of the method, tests were run using the clinical data from 21 patients. Stent modeling and extraction of the radial forces were successful in 18 cases. Synthetic test cases were generated, in addition, for assessing the sensitivity to the measurement errors. In a sensitivity analysis, the geometric error of the stent reconstruction was below 0.3 mm, which is below the image resolution. The distribution of the radial forces was qualitatively and quantitatively reasonable. An uncertainty remains in the quantitative evaluation of the radial forces due to the uncertainty in defining a radial direction on the deformed stent.

By contrast, since complex DESs are naturally organized in hierarchies of contexts, different diagnosis rules are to be defined for different contexts. Diagnosis rules are specified based on associations between context-sensitive faults and regular expressions, called semantic patterns. Since the alphabets of such regular expressions are stratified, so that the semantic patterns of a context are defined based on the interface symbols of its subcontexts only, separation of concerns is achieved, and the expressive power of diagnosis is enhanced.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows: First, we compare the energy consumption of our previously proposed energy efficient BitTorrent protocol to that of the original BitTorrent protocol and the client-server (C-S) schemes over bypass IP/WDM networks considering a range of network topologies with different number of nodes and average hop counts. Our results show that for a certain swarm size, the energy efficient BitTorrent protocol achieves higher power savings in networks with lower number of nodes as the opportunity to localize traffic increases. Second, we extend our previously developed energy efficient BitTorrent heuristic enhancing its performance by allowing peers to progressively traverse more hops in the network if the number of peers in the local node is not sufficient. Third, we extend our previously developed mixed integer linear programming model to optimize the location as well as the upload rates of operator controlled seeders (OCS) to mitigate the performance degradation caused by leechers leaving after finishing the downloading operation. Fourth, we compare the power consumption of video on demand (VoD) services delivered using content distribution networks (CDN), P2P, and a promising hybrid CDN-P2P architecture over bypass IP/WDM core networks. A MILP model is developed to carry out the comparison. We investigate two scenarios for the hybrid CDN-P2P architecture: the H-MinNPC model where the model minimizes the IP/WDM network power consumption and the H-MinTPC model where the model minimizes the total power consumption including the network and the CDN datacenters power consumption. Finally, we carry out an experimental evaluation - f the original and energy efficient BitTorrent heuristics.","10.1109/JLT.2014.2351074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6882178&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882178","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0733-8724","6882178","Energy consumption|Energy efficiency|IP networks|Peer-to-peer computing|Power demand|Protocols|WDM networks","IP networks|client-server systems|integer programming|linear programming|optical fibre networks|peer-to-peer computing|protocols|telecommunication network topology|telecommunication services|telecommunication traffic|video on demand|wavelength division multiplexing","","1"

To reduce expensive redesign steps, this control problem is generally addressed by minor incremental changes on top of consolidated solutions. A more systematic approach is hindered by a lack of rigorous design methodologies that allow estimating the impact of earlier design decisions on the final implementation. To achieve an optimal implementation that satisfies a set of requirements, we propose a platform-based methodology for electric power system design, which enables independent implementation of system topology (i.e., interconnection among elements) and control protocol by using a compositional approach. In our flow, design space exploration is carried out as a sequence of refinement steps from the initial specification toward a final implementation by mapping higher level behavioral and performance models into a set of either existing or virtual library components at the lower level of abstraction. Specifications are first expressed using the formalisms of linear temporal logic, signal temporal logic, and arithmetic constraints on Boolean variables. To reason about different requirements, we use specialized analysis and synthesis frameworks and formulate assume guarantee contracts at the articulation points in the design flow.

Buckling is a pronounced nonlinear effect that occurs at a structurally singular point. A small piezoelectric displacement on the order of 10 &#x03BC;m results in a large buckling displacement on the order of millimeter. Furthermore, the usable stroke is doubled if both sides of the singular point can be reached resulting in bipolar motion. Despite the large gain, buckling is an erratic, singular phenomenon; the side on which deflection will occur is unpredictable. In this paper, multiple design concepts are presented for regulating the buckling direction as well as for extending its usable stroke to bipolar motion. Nonlinear force-displacement relationships are modeled and measured. Nonlinear dynamic analysis using phase planes reveals that the buckling actuator can generate bipolar motion above a specific amplitude. Below this amplitude, it generates only monopolar oscillation. The proposed design concepts are implemented on monolithic flexure mechanisms, and prototype buckling actuators are tested to verify the concepts.

It is a well-known fact that the best way to increase capacity in a unit area is to introduce smaller cells. Local area communications are currently mainly driven by the IEEE 802.11 WLAN family being cheap and energy efficient with a low number of users per access point. For the future high user density scenarios, following the 802.11 HEW study group, the 802.11ax project has been initiated to improve the WLAN system performance. The 3GPP LTE-advanced (LTE-A) also includes new methods for pico and femto cell's interference management functionalities for small cell communications. The main problem with LTE-A is, however, that the physical layer numerology is still optimized for macrocells and not for local area communications. Furthermore, the overall complexity and the overheads of the control plane and reference symbols are too large for spectrally and energy efficient local area communications. In this paper, we provide first an overview of WLAN 802.11ac and LTE/LTE-A, discuss the pros and cons of both technology areas, and then derive a new flexible TDD-based radio interface parametrization for 5G local area communications combining the best practices of both WiFi and LTE-A technologies. We justify the system design based on local area propagation characteristics and expected traffic distributions and derive targets for future local area concepts. We concentrate on initial physical layer design and discuss how it maps to higher layer improvements. This paper shows that the new design can significantly reduce the latency of the system, and offer increased sleeping opportunities on both base station and user equipment sides leading to enhanced power savings. In addition, through careful design of the control overhead, we are able to improve the channel utilization when compared- with LTE-A.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2355415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6891105&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6891105","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6891105","Long Term Evolution|Mobile communication|OFDM|Physical layer|Throughput|Uplink|Wireless LAN","4G mobile communication|Long Term Evolution|femtocellular radio|picocellular radio|radiofrequency interference|telecommunication standards|telecommunication traffic|time division multiplexing|wireless LAN","","1"

With the increasing popularity of digital slide scanners, decision support systems based on the analysis of digital pathology images are in high demand. However, computerized decision support systems are fraught with problems that stem from color variations in tissue appearance due to variation in tissue preparation, variation in stain reactivity from different manufacturers/batches, user or protocol variation, and the use of scanners from different manufacturers. In this paper, we present a novel approach to stain normalization in histopathology images. The method is based on nonlinear mapping of a source image to a target image using a representation derived from color deconvolution. Color deconvolution is a method to obtain stain concentration values when the stain matrix, describing how the color is affected by the stain concentration, is given. Rather than relying on standard stain matrices, which may be inappropriate for a given image, we propose the use of a color-based classifier that incorporates a novel stain color descriptor to calculate image-specific stain matrix. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed stain matrix estimation and stain normalization methods, they are applied to the problem of tumor segmentation in breast histopathology images. The experimental results suggest that the paradigm of color normalization, as a preprocessing step, can significantly help histological image analysis algorithms to demonstrate stable performance which is insensitive to imaging conditions in general and scanner variations in particular.","10.1109/TBME.2014.2303294","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727397&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727397","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9294","6727397","Deconvolution|Estimation|Histograms|Image analysis|Image color analysis|Licenses|Training","decision support systems|deconvolution|image colour analysis|medical image processing|patient diagnosis|tumours","","1"

This makes the channel spectrum heavily shared by various underwater acoustic systems. Nevertheless, the precious spectrum resource is still underutilized temporally and spatially in underwater environments. To efficiently utilize the spectrum while avoiding harmful interference with other acoustic systems, a smart UAN should be aware of the surrounding environment and reconfigure their operation parameters. Unfortunately, existing UAN designs have mainly focused on the single network scenario, and very few studies have considered the presence of nearby acoustic activities. In this paper, we advocate cognitive acoustic as a promising technique to develop an environment-friendly UAN with high spectrum utilization. However, underwater cognitive acoustic networks (UCANs) also pose grand challenges due to the unique features of underwater channel and acoustic systems.

The problem has different settings from those typically considered in the secure computation literature, as it deals with data in rank-ordered search, and has a different security-efficiency requirement. Secure computation techniques, such as homomorphic encryption, can potentially be used in this application, at a cost of high computational and communication complexity. Alternatively, efficient techniques based on randomizing visual feature and search indexes have been proposed recently to enable similarity comparison between encrypted images. This paper focuses on comparing these two major paradigms of techniques, namely, homomorphic encryption-based techniques and feature/index randomization-based techniques, for confidentiality-preserving image search. We develop novel and systematic metrics to quantitatively evaluate security strength in this unique type of data and applications.

What is the role of color in visual information processing? To answer these (seemingly different) questions we develop an analogy between the role of orientation in organizing visual cortex and tangents in differential geometry. Machine learning experiments suggest using geometry as a surrogate for high-order statistical interactions. The cortical columnar architecture becomes a bundle structure in geometry. Connection forms within these bundles suggest answers to the above questions, and curvatures emerge in key roles. More generally, our path through these questions suggests an overall strategy for solving the inverse problems of vision: decompose the global problems into networks of smaller ones and then seek constraints from these coupled problems to reduce ambiguity. Neural computations thus amount to satisfying constraints rather than seeking uniform approximations. Even when no global formulation exists one may be able to find localized structures on which ambiguity is minimal; these can then anchor an overall approximation.","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2314723","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6804761&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6804761","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9219","6804761","Boundary conditions|Computational modeling|Feedforward neural networks|Image edge detection|Neurons|Neuroscience|Probability|Visualization","biomedical optical imaging|brain|edge detection|learning (artificial intelligence)|medical image processing|statistical analysis|stereo image processing|vision defects","",""

Here, the precise positioning of liquid-metal slugs is achieved using CEW actuation in conjunction with channels designed to minimize the liquid-metal surface energy at discrete locations. This approach leverages the high surface tension of liquid metal to control its resting position with submillimeter accuracy. The CEW actuation and fluidic channel design were optimized to create reconfigurable RF devices. In addition, solutions for the reliable actuation of a gallium-based, non-toxic liquid-metal alloy (Galinstan) are presented that mitigate the tendency of the alloy to form a surface oxide layer capable of wetting to the channel walls, inhibiting motion.

The main goal is to design systems that can adapt with the user's abilities and needs over a range of cognitive tasks. It will also enable the system to provide feedback consistent with the situation. However, the latent structure and relationship between human ability to respond to cognitive task (demand on human by the agent) remains unknown. Robust modeling of cognitive ADG will be a paradigm shift from the current trends in assistive technology design. The key idea is to estimate the gap, based on human-agent cognitive task interaction. In particular, latent response model was adopted to quantify the gap. First, we used one parameter Rasch model and extended Rasch model (rating scale model, partial credit model) with dichotomous and polytomous responses, respectively. Residues between expected and observed ability scores were considered as gap parameter in case of dichotomous response. In extended Rasch modeling, response latitudes are considered as an indicator of the gap. Additionally, we performed model fitting, standard error measurement, kernel density estimation, and differential item functioning to test the suitability of Rasch model. Empirical analyses on a number of data set show that proposed analytical method can model the cognitive ADG from dichotomous and polytomous responses. In dichotomous case, the model better fits for mixed responses (combination of easy, medium, and hard) data set rather than monotonic (e.g., only easy) data. Results show that Rasch model can be reliably used to estimate cognitive gap with different cognitive task types.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2339328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6857320&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857320","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6857320","Adaptation models|Assistive technology|Cognition|Data models|Human factors|Market research|Rasch models","cognition|ergonomics|feedback","","1"

Thus, accurate methodologies for time-varying alternans estimation/detection in EGM are needed. In this paper, we perform a simulation study based on epicardial EGM recorded in vivo in humans to compare the accuracy of four methodologies: the spectral method (SM), modified moving average method, laplacian likelihood ratio method (LLR), and a novel method based on time-frequency distributions. A variety of effects are considered, which include the presence of wide band noise, respiration, and impulse artifacts. We found that 1) EGM-TWA can be detected accurately when the standard deviation of wide-band noise is equal or smaller than ten times the magnitude of EGM-TWA. 2) Respiration can be critical for EGM-TWA analysis, even at typical respiratory rates. 3) Impulse noise strongly reduces the accuracy of all methods, except LLR. 4) If depolarization time is used as a fiducial point, the localization of the T-wave is not critical for the accuracy of EGM-TWA detection. 5) According to this study, all methodologies provided accurate EGM-TWA detection/quantification in ideal conditions, while LLR was the most robust, providing better detection-rates in noisy conditions.

Each algorithm has specific input data requirements and makes certain assumptions that may or may not hold true in a particular fault location scenario. Without a detailed understanding of the principle of each fault-locating method, choosing the most suitable fault location algorithm can be a challenging task. This paper, therefore, presents the theory of one-ended (simple reactance, Takagi, modified Takagi, Eriksson, and Novosel et al.) and two-ended (synchronized, unsynchronized, and current-only) impedance-based fault location algorithms and demonstrates their application in locating real-world faults. The theory details the formulation and input data requirement of each fault-locating algorithm and evaluates the sensitivity of each to the following error sources: 1) load; 2) remote infeed; 3) fault resistance; 4) mutual coupling; 5) inaccurate line impedances; 6) DC offset and CT saturation; 7) three-terminal lines; and 8) tapped radial lines. From the theoretical analysis and field data testing, the following criteria are recommended for choosing the most suitable fault-locating algorithm: 1) data availability and 2) fault location application scenario. Another objective of this paper is to assess what additional information can be gleaned from waveforms recorded by intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) during a fault.

This model, called VQM_VFD, uses perceptual features extracted from spatialtemporal blocks spanning fixed angular extents and a long edge detection filter. VQM_VFD predicts video quality by measuring multiple frame delays using perception based parameters to track subjective quality over time. In the performance analysis of VQM_VFD, we evaluated its efficacy at predicting human opinions of visual quality. A detailed correlation analysis and statistical hypothesis testing show that VQM_VFD accurately predicts human subjective judgments and substantially outperforms top-performing image quality assessment and VQA models previously tested on the LIVE mobile VQA database. VQM_VFD achieved the best performance on the mobile and tablet studies of the LIVE mobile VQA database for simulated compression, wireless packet-loss, and rate adaptation, but not for temporal dynamics. These results validate the new model and warrant a hard release of the VQM_VFD algorithm.","10.1109/TBC.2014.2365260","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6954510&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6954510","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9316","6954510","Databases|Delays|Image edge detection|PSNR|Quality assessment|Video recording|Video sequences","delays|distortion|video signal processing","","1"

Claddings based on a polymer matrix containing chromophores have been introduced, and their strong &#x03C7;<sup>(2)</sup> nonlinearity has already been used to demonstrate ultralow power consuming modulators. However, these silicon-organic hybrid (SOH) devices inherit not only the advantageous properties; these polymer claddings require an alignment procedure called poling and must be operated well below their glass transition temperature. This excludes some applications. In contrast, claddings made from organic crystals come with a different set of properties. In particular, there is no need for poling. This new class of claddings also promises stronger resilience to high temperatures, better long-term stability, and photo-chemical stability. We report on the deposition of an organic crystal cladding of N-benzyl-2-methyl-4-nitroaniline (BNA) on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides, which have a CMOS-like metal stack on top.

In this paper, we present MVCWalker, an innovative method that stands on the shoulders of random walk with restart (RWR) for recommending collaborators to scholars. Three academic factors, i.e., coauthor order, latest collaboration time, and times of collaboration, are exploited to define link importance in academic social networks for the sake of recommendation quality. We conducted extensive experiments on DBLP data set in order to compare MVCWalker to the basic model of RWR and the common neighbor-based model friend of friends in various aspects, including, e.g., the impact of critical parameters and academic factors.

The aim of this paper was to examine the effect of head elevation with jaw closure using a remote-controlled airbag device, such as the airbag system, on passive upper airway collapsibility during propofol anesthesia. Seven male subjects were studied. Propofol infusion was used for anesthesia induction and maintenance, with a target blood propofol concentration of 1.5-2 &#x03BC;g/ml. Nasal mask pressure (P<sub>N</sub>) was intermittently reduced to evaluate upper airway collapsibility (passive P<sub>CRIT</sub>) and upstream resistance (R<sub>US</sub>) at three different head and jaw positions, jaw opening position in the supine position, jaw opening position in the sniffing position with 6-cm head elevation, and jaw closure at a 6-cm height sniffing position. The 6-cm height sniffing position with jaw closure was achieved by an airbag device that was attached to the subject's head-like headgear. Patient demographics, P<sub>CRIT</sub> and R<sub>US</sub> in each condition were compared using one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey test. P &lt;; 0.05 was considered significant. We also confirmed the effects of our airbag device on improvement of upper airway collapsibility in three obstructive sleep apnea patients in a clinical study. The combination of 6-cm head elevation with jaw closure using the air-inflatable robotic airbag system decreased upper airway collapsibility (P<sub>CRIT</sub> ~ -3.4-cm H<sub>2</sub>O) compared with the baseline position (P<sub>CRIT</sub> ~ -0.8-cm H<sub>2</sub>O, P = 0.0001). In the clinical study, there was improvement of upper airway obstruction in sleep apnea patients, including decreased apnea and hypopnea duration and increased the lowest level of oxygen saturation. We demonstrated that establishment of head elevation with jaw closure achi- ved by a remote-controlled airbag device using an inflatable airbag system can produce substantial decreases in upper airway collapsibility and maintain upper airway patency during propofol anesthesia and sleep.","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2321062","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6811201&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6811201","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2372","6811201","Anesthesia|Head manipulation|Magnetic heads|Maintenance engineering|Robots|Sleep apnea","biomedical equipment|biomedical measurement|bone|demography|drugs|inflatable structures|medical disorders|medical robotics|oxygen|patient treatment|pneumodynamics|position control|sleep|statistical analysis|telerobotics","","1"

These have important implications. In the case of antenna array processing, it allows for joint localization and extraction of multiple sources from the measurement of a noisy mixture recorded on multiple sensors in an entirely deterministic manner. In the case of CDMA, it allows the possibility of having a number of users larger than the spreading gain. In the case of fluorescence spectroscopy, it allows for detection of nearly identical chemical constituents. The proposed technique involves the solution of a bounded coherence low-rank multilinear approximation problem. We show that bounded coherence allows us to establish existence and uniqueness of the recovered solution. We will provide some statistical motivation for the approximation problem and discuss greedy approximation bounds. To provide the theoretical underpinnings for this technique, we develop a corresponding theory of sparse separable decompositions of functions, including notions of rank and nuclear norm that can be specialized to the usual ones for matrices and operators and also be applied to hypermatrices and tensors.","10.1109/TIT.2013.2291876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6671475&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671475","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9448","6671475","Approximation methods|Hilbert space|Inverse problems|Matrix decomposition|Singular value decomposition|Tensile stress|Vectors","antenna arrays|approximation theory|blind source separation|channel estimation|code division multiple access|fluorescence spectroscopy|inverse problems|radiocommunication","","1"

In this paper, we describe a method for performing automated classification of ASC images into three mutually exclusive classes: aurora, no aurora, and cloudy. This not only reduces the amount of data to be processed, but also facilitates in building statistical models linking the magnetic fluctuations and auroral activity helping us to get a step closer to forecasting auroral activity. We experimented with different feature extraction techniques coupled with Support Vector Machines classification. Color variants of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features, specifically Opponent SIFT features, were found to perform better than other feature extraction techniques. With Opponent SIFT features, we were able to build a classification model with a cross-validation accuracy of 91%, which was further improved using temporal information and elimination of outliers which makes it accurate enough for operational data pruning purposes.

A series of MRRs incorporated with an add/drop filter system was utilized to generate multicarriers in the 193.00999-193.01001-THz range, which were used to all-optically generate two MIMO wireless local area network radio frequency (RF) signals suitable for the IEEE802.11n standard communication systems, and single wavelengths at frequencies of 193.08, 193.1, and 193.12 THz with free spectral range of 20 GHz used to optically transport the separated MIMO signals over a single-mode fiber (SMF). The error vector magnitude (EVM) and bit error rate of the overall system performance are discussed. Results show that the generated RF signals wirelessly propagated through the MIMO channel using the 2 &#x00D7; 2 MIMO Tx antennas. There is an acceptable EVM variation for wireless distance lower than 70, 30, and 15 m. It can be concluded that the transmission of both MIMO RF signals is feasible for up to a 50-km SMF path length and a wireless distance of 15 m.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2363437","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923468&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6923468","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6923468","MIMO|OFDM|Optical fibers|Optical pulses|Optical ring resonators|Optical transmitters|Solitons","MIMO communication|micromechanical resonators|multiplexing|radio-over-fibre|transmitting antennas|wireless LAN","","1"

If GO term xis existence-dependent on GO term y, the presence of y implies the presence of x. Therefore, the genes annotated with the function of the GO term y are usually functionally and semantically related to the genes annotated with the function of the GO term x. A large number of gene set enrichment analysis methods have been developed in recent years for analyzing gene sets enrichment. However, most of these methods overlook the structural dependencies between GO terms in GO graph by not considering the concept of existence dependency. We propose in this paper a biological search engine called RSGSearch that identifies enriched sets of genes annotated with different functions using the concept of existence dependency. We observe that GO term xcannot be existence-dependent on GO term y, if x- and y- have the same specificity (biological characteristics). After encoding into a numeric format the contributions of GO terms annotating target genes to the semantics of their lowest common ancestors (LCAs), RSGSearch uses microarray experiment to identify the most significant LCA that annotates the result genes. We evaluated RSGSearch experimentally and compared it with five gene set enrichment systems.

Remote sensing big data consist of many large-scale images that are extremely complex in terms of their structural, spectral, and textual features. Based on multiresolution analysis theory, most of the natural images are sparse and have obvious clustering and persistence characters when they are transformed into another domain by a group of basic special functions. In this paper, we use a wavelet transform to represent remote sensing big data that are large scale in the space domain, correlated in the spectral domain, and continuous in the time domain. We decompose the big data set into approximate multiscale detail coefficients based on a wavelet transform. In order to determine whether the density function of wavelet coefficients in a big data set are peaky at zero and have a heavy tailed shape, a two-component Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is employed. For the first time, we use the expectation-maximization likelihood method to estimate the model parameters for the remote sensing big data set in the wavelet domain. The variance of the GMM with changing of bands, time, and scale are comprehensively analyzed. The statistical characteristics of different textures are also compared. We find that the cluster characteristics of the wavelet coefficients are still obvious in the remote sensing big data set for different bands and different scales. However, it is not always precise when we model the long-term sequence data set using the GMM. We also found that the scale features of different textures for the big data set are obviously reflected in the probability density function and GMM parameters of the wavelet coefficients.","10.1109/TETC.2014.2356499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6897952&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6897952","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-6750","6897952","Big data|Earth|Hidden Markov models|Multiresolution analysis|Remote sensing|Satellites|Wavelet transforms","Big Data|Gaussian processes|geophysics computing|image resolution|mixture models|remote sensing|statistical analysis|wavelet transforms","","1"

This paper investigates how DMR performs as a function of the number of snapshots used to estimate the SCM. The analysis focuses on the fundamental case of a single interferer in white noise. Theoretical calculations for the ensemble case reveal the relationships among notch depth, white noise gain, and SINR. The centerpiece of the paper is a detailed empirical study of the single-interferer case, which includes snapshot-deficient scenarios often ignored in previous work. Empirical data demonstrate that the sample eigenvectors determine the mean performance of the DMR ABF. On a log-log plot the mean notch depth is a piecewise linear function of the number of snapshots and the interference-to-noise ratio. The paper interprets the behavior of the DMR ABF using recent results on sample eigenvectors derived from random matrix theory.","10.1109/JOE.2013.2251538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6516096&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516096","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0364-9059","6516096","","adaptive signal detection|adaptive signal processing|array signal processing|covariance matrices|eigenvalues and eigenfunctions|sonar signal processing|white noise","","1"

Here, we discuss some of these considerations, and the delicate balance necessary for the construction of a practical processor that respects the demanding physical requirements imposed by a quantum algorithm. In particular, we will review some of the design tradeoffs at play in the floor planning of the physical layout, driven by the desire to have an algorithmically useful set of interqubit couplers, and the simultaneous need to embed programmable control circuitry into the processor fabric. In this context, we have developed a new ultralow-power embedded superconducting digital-to-analog flux converter (DAC) used to program the processor with zero static power dissipation, optimized to achieve maximum flux storage density per unit area. The 512 single-stage, 3520 two-stage, and 512 three-stage flux DACs are controlled with an XYZ addressing scheme requiring 56 wires.

For dynamic studies the measured uptake time-course information can be best interpreted when knowledge of the time-course of tracer in the blood is available. This is certainly true for the most established tracers such as <sup>18</sup>F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and <sup>15</sup>O-Water (H 2O). Since direct sampling of blood as part of PET studies is increasingly impractical, there is ongoing interest in image-extraction of blood time-course information. But analysis of PET-measured blood pool signals is complicated because they will typically involve a combination of arterial, venous and tissue information. Thus, a careful appreciation of these components is needed to interpret the available data. To facilitate this process, we propose a novel Markov chain model for representation of the circulation of a tracer atom in the body. The model represents both arterial and venous time-course patterns. Under reasonable conditions equilibration of tracer activity in arterial and venous blood is achieved by the end of the PET study-consistent with empirical measurement. Statistical inference for Markov model parameters is a challenge. A penalized nonlinear least squares process, incorporating a generalized cross-validation score, is proposed. Random effects analysis is used to adaptively specify the structure of the penalty function based on historical samples of directly measured blood data. A collection of arterially sampled data from PET studies with FDG and H 2O is used to illustrate the methodology. These data analyses are highly supportive of the overall modeling approach. An adaptation of the model to the problem of extraction of arterial blood signals from imaging data is also developed and promising preliminary results for cerebral and thoracic imaging studies with FDG and H<sub>2</sub>O are obtained.","10.1109/TMI.2014.2305113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6734713&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6734713","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0278-0062","6734713","Adaptation models|Atomic measurements|Blood circulation|Blood pressure|Markov processes|Numerical models|Positron emission tomography","Markov processes|blood|blood vessels|haemodynamics|least squares approximations|medical image processing|positron emission tomography|statistical analysis","","1"

The approach is able to track multiple targets and estimates the unknown number of targets. Furthermore, it is capable of dealing with three sources of uncertainty: stochastic, set-theoretic, and data association uncertainty. The box-PHD filter reduces the number of particles significantly, which improves the runtime considerably. The small number of box-particles makes this approach attractive for distributed inference, especially when particles have to be shared over networks. A box-particle is a random sample that occupies a small and controllable rectangular region of non-zero volume. Manipulation of boxes utilizes methods from the field of interval analysis. The theoretical derivation of the box-PHD filter is presented followed by a comparative analysis with a standard sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) version of the PHD filter. To measure the performance objectively three measures are used: inclusion, volume, and the optimum subpattern assignment (OSPA) metric. Our studies suggest that the box-PHD filter reaches similar accuracy results, like an SMC-PHD filter but with considerably less computational costs. Furthermore, we can show that in the presence of strongly biased measurement the box-PHD filter even outperforms the classical SMC-PHD filter.","10.1109/TAES.2014.120238","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6965728&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965728","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9251","6965728","Approximation methods|Atmospheric measurements|Noise measurement|Particle measurements|Target tracking|Uncertainty","Monte Carlo methods|particle filtering (numerical methods)|probability|sensor fusion|set theory|target tracking","","1"

First, a compensation algorithm for output voltage sampling is introduced. It can not only effectively eliminate the output voltage steady-state error but also guarantee current observer convergence.

In addition, the feature sets and similarity measures utilized in these systems are not suitable for existing template protection techniques. Moreover, local structural change caused by nonlinear distortion is often not considered adequately in these systems. In this paper, we propose a Delaunay quadrangle-based fingerprint authentication system to deal with nonlinear distortion-induced local structural change that the Delaunay triangle-based structure suffers. Fixed-length and alignment-free feature vectors extracted from Delaunay quadrangles are less sensitive to nonlinear distortion and more discriminative than those from Delaunay triangles and can be applied to existing template protection directly. Furthermore, we propose to construct a unique topology code from each Delaunay quadrangle. Not only can this unique topology code help to carry out accurate local registration under distortion, but it also enhances the security of template data. Experimental results on public databases and security analysis show that the Delaunay quadrangle-based system with topology code can achieve better performance and higher security level than the Delaunay triangle-based system, the Delaunay quadrangle-based system without topology code, and some other similar systems.","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2328095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6824822&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824822","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1556-6013","6824822","Authentication|Cryptography|Feature extraction|Fingerprint recognition|Nonlinear distortion|Topology","authorisation|fingerprint identification|mesh generation|nonlinear distortion|set theory","","1"

Packet collisions are considered to be the main source of data loss in contention-based vehicular networks. Retransmission of collided packets is done several times until an acknowledgment of successful reception is received or the maximum number of retries is reached. The retransmission delay is drawn randomly from an interval, called the backoff interval. A good choice of the backoff interval reduces the number of collisions and the waiting periods of data packets, which increases the throughput and decreases the energy consumption. An optimal backoff interval could be obtained if global network information spread in the network in a short time. However, this is practically not achievable which motivates the efficient utilization of local information to approach the optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a localized adaptive strategy that calculates the backoff interval for unicast applications in vehicular networks. The new strategy uses fuzzy logic to adapt the backoff interval to the fast changing vehicular environment using only local information. We present four schemes of that strategy that differ in their behavior and the number of inputs. We compare the proposed schemes with other known schemes, binary exponential backoff, backoff algorithm, and an optimal scheme, in terms of throughput, fairness, and energy consumption. Results show that by proper tuning of the fuzzy parameters and rules, one of the proposed schemes outperform the other schemes, and approach the optimal results.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2309856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6762837&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6762837","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6762837","Delays|Fuzzy logic|Media Access Protocol|Throughput|Transmitters|Vehicle dynamics","fuzzy logic|fuzzy reasoning|packet radio networks|telecommunication computing|vehicular ad hoc networks|wireless channels","","1"

The first approach is model free and utilizes regularized regression. It is flexible enough to be used as predictors bivalirudin infusion rates measured over several time instances before the time at which a PTT prediction is sought. The second approach is model based and proposes a specific model for obtaining PTT which uses a shorter history of the past measurements. We learn population-wide model parameters by solving a nonlinear optimization problem. We also devise an adaptive algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter that can adapt model parameters to individual patients. The latter adaptive model emerges as the most promising as it yields reduced mean error compared to the model-free approach.

We study the optimization of three cloud services: cloud content delivery, storage as a service (StaaS), and virtual machines (VMS) placement for processing applications. First, we develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimize cloud content delivery services. Our results indicate that replicating content into multiple clouds based on content popularity yields 43% total saving in power consumption compared to power un-aware centralized content delivery. Based on the model insights, we develop an energy efficient cloud content delivery heuristic, DEER-CD, with comparable power efficiency to the MILP results. Second, we extend the content delivery model to optimize StaaS applications. The results show that migrating content according to its access frequency yields up to 48% network power savings compared to serving content from a single central location. Third, we optimize the placement of VMs to minimize the total power consumption. Our results show that slicing the VMs into smaller VMs and placing them in proximity to their users saves 25% of the total power compared to a single virtualized cloud scenario.

This necessitates consideration of the use the PSP on non-asymptotic integrals and leads to the introduction of a test for phase rate dominance. Regions of the TF plane that pass the test and do not contain stationary phase points contribute little or nothing to the final output. Analysis values that lie in these regions can thus be set to zero, i.e., sparsity. In regions of the TF plane that fail the test or are in the vicinity of stationary phase points, synthesis is performed in the usual way. A new interpretation of the location parameters associated with the synthesis filters leads to: i) a new method for locating stationary phase points in the TF plane and ii) a test for phase rate dominance in that plane. Together this is a TF stationary phase approximation (TFSPA) for both analysis and synthesis. The stationary phase regions of several elementary signals are identified theoretically and examples of reconstruction given. An analysis of the TF phase rate characteristics for the case of two simultaneous tones predicts and quantifies a form of simultaneous masking similar to that which characterizes the auditory system.","10.1109/TSP.2013.2284479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6620957&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6620957","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1053-587X","6620957","Approximation methods|Auditory system|Bandwidth|Chirp|Frequency response|Prototypes|Time-frequency analysis","","","1"

Estimating recombination rate is crucial for understanding the process of recombination. Experimental methods are normally difficult and limited to small scale estimations. Thus statistical methods using population genetics data are important for large-scale analysis. LDhat is an extensively used statistical method using rjMCMC algorithm to predict recombination rates. Due to the complexity of rjMCMC scheme, LDhat may take a long time for large SNP data sets. In addition, rjMCMC parameters should be manually defined in the original program which directly impact results. To address these issues, we designed an improved algorithm based on LDhat implementing MCMC convergence diagnostic algorithms to automatically predict values of parameters and monitor the mixing process. Then parallel computation methods were employed to further accelerate the new program. The new algorithms have been tested on ten samples from HapMap phase 2 data set. The results were compared with previous code and showed nearly identical output. However, our new methods achieved significant acceleration proving that they are more efficient and reliable for the estimation of recombination rates.

Both a single exemplar measure of information, separability, and its ensemble average equivalent, separation, are shown to measure the information support for decision quality (i.e., how well-informed is the decision), rather than the information support for decision adjudication (i.e., which hypothesis is the better choice) provided by predecision information measures. When compared to the traditional receiver operating characteristic, these measures present several functional advantages. They are scalar in nature, and may be directly optimized over secondary parameters, as well as being rigorously well posed and universally comparable. They incorporate the effects of all relevant decision components (prior information, observational information, and decision rule) in a unified manner while still being easily related to the predecision information measures of log likelihood ratio and generalized signal-to-noise ratio. They can be applied equally well to individual trials or composite averages, and evaluation does not require knowledge of the underlying truth.

For example, the 4G long term evolution (LTE) system takes advantage of multiport antennas [multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology] and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to improve the detection probability of single bitstream by diversity in the spatial and frequency domains, respectively. The 4G system also supports transmission of two bitstreams by appropriate signal processing of the MIMO subchannels. The reverberation chamber emulates according to previous works rich isotropic multipath (RIMP) and has proven to be very useful for characterizing smart phones for LTE systems. The measured throughput can be accurately modeled by the simple digital threshold receiver, accounting accurately for both the MIMO and OFDM functions. The throughput is equivalent to the probability of detection (PoD) of the transmitted bitstream. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a systematic approach to include the statistical properties of the user and his or her terminal, when characterizing the performance. The user statistics will have a larger effect in environments with stronger line-of-sight (LOS), because the angle of arrival and the polarization of the LOS contribution vary due to the user's orientation and practices. These variations are stochastic, and therefore, we introduce the term random-LOS to describe this. This paper elaborates on the characterization of an example antenna in both RIMP and random-LOS. The chosen antenna is a wideband microbase transceiver station (BTS) antenna. We show how to characterize the micro-BTS by the PoD of one and two bitstreams in both RIMP and random-LOS, by considering the user randomly located and oriented within the angular coverage sector. We limit the treatment to a wall-mounted BTS antenna, and assume a desired hemispherical coverage. The angular coverages of both one and two bitst- eams for the random-LOS case are plotted as MIMO-coverage radiation patterns of the whole four-port digital antenna system. Such characterizations in terms of PoD have never been done before on any practical antenna system. The final results are easy to interpret, and they open up a new world of opportunities for designing and optimizing 5G antennas on system level.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2358937","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6902753&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6902753","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6902753","Broadband antennas|MIMO|Mobile communication|Next generation networking|OFDM|Reverberation chambers|Statistical analysis|Wireless networks","4G mobile communication|Long Term Evolution|MIMO communication|OFDM modulation|antenna arrays|antenna radiation patterns|radio receivers|reverberation chambers|smart phones|transceivers","","1"

In this paper, we describe a new way of thinking about cognitive control that embodies two basic components: learning and planning, both of which are based on two notions: 1) two-state model of the environment and the perceptor and 2) perception-action cycle, which is a distinctive characteristic of the cognitive dynamic system. Most importantly, it is shown that the cognitive control learning algorithm is a special form of Bellman's dynamic programming. Distinctive properties of the new algorithm include the following: 1) optimality of performance; 2) algorithmic convergence to optimal policy; and 3) linear law of complexity measured in terms of the number of actions taken by the cognitive controller on the environment. To validate these intrinsic properties of the algorithm, a computational experiment is presented, which involves a cognitive tracking radar that is known to closely mimic the visual brain. The experiment illustrates two different scenarios: 1) the impact of planning on learning curves of the new cognitive controller and 2) comparison of the learning curves of three different controllers, based on dynamic optimization, traditional (Q) -learning, and the new algorithm. The latter two algorithms are based on the two-state model, and they both involve the use of planning.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2332333","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6843352&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6843352","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6843352","Brain modeling|Cognition|Complexity theory|Control systems|Dynamic programming|Heuristic algorithms|Perception|Radar tracking","cognition|computational complexity|dynamic programming","","1"

To do so, dedicated torque-vectoring (TV) controllers that allow optimal wheel torque distribution under all possible driving conditions have to be developed. Commonly, vehicle TV controllers are based on a hierarchical approach, consisting of a high-level supervisory controller that evaluates a corrective yaw moment and a low-level controller that defines the individual wheel torque reference values. The problem of the optimal individual wheel torque distribution for a particular driving condition can be solved through an optimization-based control-allocation (CA) algorithm, which must rely on the appropriate selection of the objective function. With a newly developed offline optimization procedure, this paper assesses the performance of alternative objective functions for the optimal wheel torque distribution of a four-wheel-drive (4WD) fully electric vehicle. Results show that objective functions based on the minimum tire slip criterion provide better control performance than functions based on energy efficiency.","10.1109/TVT.2013.2289371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6656947&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6656947","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9545","6656947","Linear programming|Optimization|TV|Tires|Torque|Vehicles|Wheels","braking|electric vehicles|optimisation|torque|torque control|wheels","",""

The mechanism of bending effect in proposed PDCF and the experimental setup for amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) based sensor and fiber laser based sensor is illustrated. For ASE sensor, the higher ASE power level loss as the spooling radius is reduced from 20 to 3 cm is measured. The gain peak shift to shorter wavelength with respect to the decrease of the spooling radius from 20 to 3 cm due to higher bending loss at smaller bending radius is observed. The results are in agreement with overlap factor variation of PDCF. As expected from ASE peaks variation, the fiber laser sensor spectral operation is changed from 1539 to 1530 nm range. This phenomenon is due to higher mode field diameter of longer wavelength and result of optical filtering at longer wavelengths. The experimental results showed the output of the ASE is also highly stable, with no observable variation in the power output over a measurement period of 1 h.

However, most of them cannot deal with the cold-start problem that denotes a situation that social media sites fail to draw recommendation for new items, users or both. In addition, they regard that all ratings equally contribute to the social media recommendation. This supposition is against the fact that low-level ratings contribute little to suggesting items that are likely to be of interest of users. To this end, we propose bi-clustering and fusion (BiFu)-a newly-fashioned scheme for the cold-start problem based on the BiFu techniques under a cloud computing setting. To identify the rating sources for recommendation, it introduces the concepts of popular items and frequent raters. To reduce the dimensionality of the rating matrix, BiFu leverages the bi-clustering technique. To overcome the data sparsity and rating diversity, it employs the smoothing and fusion technique. Finally, BiFu recommends social media contents from both item and user clusters.

One ongoing bottleneck lies in providing users with automatic nematode segmentations of C. elegans in image sequences featuring complex and dynamic visual cues, a first and necessary step prior to extracting motility phenotypes. Here, we propose to tackle such automatic segmentation challenges by introducing a novel texture factor model (TFM). Our approach revolves around the use of combined intensity- and texture-based features integrated within a probabilistic framework. This strategy first provides a coarse nematode segmentation from which a Markov random field model is used to refine the segmentation by inferring pixels belonging to the nematode using an approximate inference technique. Finally, informative priors can then be estimated and integrated in our framework to provide coherent segmentations across image sequences. We validate our TFM method across a wide range of motility environments. Not only does TFM assure comparative performances to existing segmentation methods on traditional environments featuring static backgrounds, it importantly provides state-of-the-art C. elegans segmentations for dynamic environments such as the recently introduced wet granular media. We show how such segmentations may be used to compute nematode &#x201C;skeletons&#x201D; from which motility phenotypes can then be extracted.

Using this information, electrical, mechanical, and image-based characterization of the myocardium are performed. The presented framework allows the left ventricle to be segmented by DE-MRI and the scar to be characterized prior to the intervention based on image information. It allows the electro-anatomical maps obtained during the intervention from a navigation system to be merged together with the anatomy and scar information extracted from DE-MRI. It also allows for the estimation of endocardial motion and deformation to assess cardiac mechanics. Therefore, electrical, mechanical, and image-based characterization of the myocardium can be performed. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated on three patients with ventricular tachycardia associated to ischemic cardiomyopathy by integrating images from DE-MRI and electro-anatomical maps data in a common framework for intraoperative myocardial tissue characterization. The proposed framework has the potential to guide and monitor delivery of radio frequency ablation of ventricular tachycardia. It is also helpful for research purposes, facilitating the study of the relationship between electrical and mechanical properties of the tissue, as well as with tissue viability from DE-MRI.","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2354332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6891115&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6891115","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2372","6891115","Biomedical imaging|Catheters|Heart|Image segmentation|Magnetic resonance imaging|Myocardium|Three-dimensional displays","bioelectric phenomena|biological tissues|biomechanics|biomedical MRI|cardiology|catheters|deformation|image fusion|image segmentation|medical image processing|motion estimation|patient treatment","","1"

These two distance measurements are equivalent in the sense that they yield the same k-means clustering result for identical sets of k initial centroids. Thus, an efficient algorithm used for one is applicable to the other. Several optimization methods are available for the Euclidean distance and can be used for processing the standardized Euclidean distance; however, they are not customized for this context. We instead approached the problem by studying the properties of the Pearson correlation distance, and we invented a simple but powerful heuristic method for markedly pruning unnecessary computation while retaining the final solution.

A stochastic geometry-based approach is accordingly employed to systematically develop a bounded expression of ergodic rate with different cellular association and load-balancing strategies. Employing the proposed unified framework hence allows for relaxation of several major limitations in the existing state-of-the-art models, in particular the always-transmitting-BSs, uncorrelated interferers, and Rayleigh fading assumptions. We elaborate on the usefulness of adopting this methodology by providing detailed analysis of the aggregate network interference generated by interdependent load-proportional sources over Nakagami-m fading interfering channels.

These new approaches offer users increased accuracy, efficiency, consumption, and data compatibility compared to traditional methods. In general, we find that spatial data content and quality index systems vary widely across different arable land regions. Thus, a system for the investigation of arable land quality indices that has the flexibility to utilize various types of spatial data and quality indices without requiring program modification is needed. This paper presents the framework, the module partition, and the structure of the data exchange interface for a highly flexible mobile GIS-based system, which we call the &#x201C;arable land quality index data collection system&#x201D; (ALQIDCS). This system incorporates a series of self-adaptive methods, a data table-driven model and two types of formulas for flexible data collection and processing. We tested our prototype system by investigating arable land quality in the Da Xing District, Beijing and in the Te Da La Qi District, Inner Mongolia, China. The results indicate that the ALQIDCS can effectively adapt to variations in spatial data and quality index systems and meet different objectives. The limitations of the ALQIDCS and suggestions for future work are also presented.","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2320635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6815642&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6815642","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1939-1404","6815642","Data collection|Data models|Geographic information systems|Indexes|Mobile communication|Spatial databases|Vectors","electronic data interchange|geographic information systems|geophysical techniques","","1"

When using line admittances, it reveals the static internal connectivity structure of the underlying network, while using power flows highlights islands with minimal power flow disruption, and thus it naturally relates to controlled islanding.

The use of advanced 3D printing technology enhanced with component placement and electrical interconnect deposition can provide electronic prototypes that now can be rapidly fabricated in comparable time frames as traditional 2D bread-boarded prototypes; however, these 3D prototypes include the advantage of being embedded within more appropriate shapes in order to authentically prototype products earlier in the development cycle.

Enhanced 3D printing may eventually be employed to manufacture end-use parts and thus offer unit-level customization with local manufacturing; however, until the materials and dimensional accuracies improve (an eventuality), 3D printing technologies can be employed to reduce development times by providing advanced geometrically appropriate electronic prototypes.

The aim of this paper was to develop a system to investigate the relationship between voiding dysfunction and alteration of the shape of the prostatic urethra by processing endoscopic video images of the urethra and analyzing the fluid dynamics of the urine stream. A panoramic image of the prostatic urethra was generated from cystourethroscopic video images. A virtual 3-D model of the urethra was constructed using the luminance values in the image. Fluid dynamics using the constructed model was then calculated assuming a static urethra and maximum urine flow rate. Cystourethroscopic videos from 11 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were recorded around administration of an alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist. The calculated pressure loss through the prostatic urethra in each model corresponded to the prostatic volume, and the improvements of the pressure loss after treatment correlated to the conventional clinical indices. As shown by the proposed method, the shape of the prostatic urethra affects the transporting urine fluid energy, and this paper implies a possible method for detecting critical lesions responsible for voiding dysfunction. The proposed method provides critical information about deformation of the prostatic urethra on voiding function.

One class of models, the reaction-diffusion models, is built around the idea that hydrogen is released from the interface and that it is the diffusion of some form of hydrogen that controls both degradation and recovery. Although various variants of the reaction-diffusion idea have been published over the years, the most commonly used recent models are based on nondispersive reaction rates and nondispersive diffusion. The other class of models is based on the idea that degradation is controlled by first-order reactions with widely distributed (dispersive) reaction rates. We demonstrate that these two classes give fundamentally different predictions for the stochastic degradation and recovery of nanoscale devices, therefore providing the ultimate modeling benchmark. Using detailed experimental time-dependent defect spectroscopy data obtained on such nanoscale devices, we investigate the compatibility of these models with experiment. Our results show that the diffusion of hydrogen (or any other species) is unlikely to be the limiting aspect that determines degradation. On the other hand, the data are fully consistent with reaction-limited models. We finally argue that only the correct understanding of the physical mechanisms leading to the significant device-to-device variation observed in the degradation in nanoscale devices will enable accurate reliability projections and device optimization.","10.1109/TED.2014.2353578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6902764&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6902764","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9383","6902764","Annealing|Data models|Degradation|Dispersion|Nanoscale devices|Predictive models|Stress","MOSFET|diffusion|nanoelectronics|negative bias temperature instability|semiconductor device models|semiconductor device reliability","","1"

At the scintillator level it is related to the intrinsic light yield, the pulse shape (rise time and decay time) and the light transport from the gamma-ray conversion point to the photodetector. When aiming at 10 ps time resolution, fluctuations in the thermalization and relaxation time of hot electrons and holes generated by the interaction of ionization radiation with the crystal become important. These processes last for up to a few tens of ps and are followed by a complex trapping-detrapping process, Poole-Frenkel effect, Auger ionization of traps and electron-hole recombination, which can last for a few ns with very large fluctuations. This paper will review the different processes at work and evaluate if some of the transient phenomena taking place during the fast thermalization phase can be exploited to extract a time tag with a precision in the few ps range. A very interesting part of the sequence is when the hot electrons and holes pass below the limit of the ionization threshold. The only way to relax their energy is then through collisions with the lattice resulting in the production of optical and acoustic phonons with relatively high energy (up to several tens of meV) near the ionization threshold. As the rate of such electron/phonon exchange is about 100 events/ps/electron or hole and as the number of electrons/holes generated after mutiplication in a high light yield scintillator like LSO can be as high as 100,000 or more, we end up with an energy deposition rate of about 100 KeV/ps. This energy deposition rate contributes to many fast processes with a characteristic time in the ps range such as band-to-band luminescence, hot intraband luminescence, acoustic shock wave generation, fast local variation of index of refraction, etc. We will discuss if the part of the total energy which is rel- ased this way, and which can represent between 50% and 90% of the energy of the incoming ionization radiation, can be efficiently exploited to improve the time resolution of scintillators, presently limited to the 100 ps range.","10.1109/TNS.2013.2282232","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6651724&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6651724","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9499","6651724","Absorption|Charge carrier processes|Crystals|Luminescence|Phonons|Photonics|Transient analysis","hot carriers|ionisation|phonons|photoluminescence|refractive index|shock waves|solid scintillation detectors","","1"

In contrast to conventional VP where the search for perturbation vectors involves all users' symbols, here, the perturbation is applied to a subset of the transmitted symbols. This, therefore, introduces a performance-complexity tradeoff, where the complexity is greatly reduced compared to VP by limiting the dimensions of the sphere search, at the expense of a performance penalty compared to VP. By changing the size of the subset of perturbed users, the aforementioned tradeoff can be controlled to maximize energy efficiency. We further propose three distinct criteria for selecting which users' symbols to perturb, each of which yields a different performance-complexity tradeoff. The presented analytical and simulation results show that partially perturbing the data provides a favorable tradeoff, particularly at low-power transmission where the power consumption associated with the signal processing becomes dominant. In fact, it is shown that diversity close to the one for conventional VP can be achieved at energy efficiency levels improved by up to 300% compared to VP.","10.1109/TWC.2014.2329480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6827257&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827257","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1536-1276","6827257","Complexity theory|Educational institutions|Lattices|Optimization|Transmitters|Vectors|Wireless communication","perturbation techniques|precoding|signal processing|telecommunication power management","","1"

First, the use of the transfer matrix method to analyze plane wave propagation in such structures to determine the transmittance and reflectance is developed. Examples of cases where the Bragg bandgap and the so-called zero &lt;;(n ) &gt; gap can be used for possible applications in sensing are illustrated. Next, the transfer matrix approach is extended to simulate the spatial evolution of a collection of propagating and nonpropagating TE and TM plane waves (or plane wave spectra) incident on such multilayer structures. The use of the complex Poynting theorem in checking the computations, as well as monitoring powers and the stored electric or magnetic energy in any section of the multilayer stack, is illustrated, along with its use in designing alternating positive and negative index structures with optimal gain to compensate for losses in the negative index material.

At ultrafast transmission rates, ISI becomes a dominant component of the BER, and its effect on the BER should be carefully addressed. One solution to this problem, termed the bit-pattern-dependent (PD) approach, is to first calculate the conditional BER given a specific bit pattern and then average over all possible bit patterns. Alternatively, a simplifying method, termed the bit-pattern-independent (PI) approach, has been commonly used whereby the average bit stream is used to calculate the distribution of the receiver output, which, in turn, is used to calculate the BER. However, when ISI is dominant, the PI approximation is inaccurate. Here, the two approaches are analytically compared by analyzing their asymptotic behavior and their bounds. Conditions are found to determine when the PI method overestimates the BER. The BER found using the PD method exponentially decays with the received optical power, whereas for the PI approach, the BER converges to a constant, which is unrealistic. For an InP-based APD receiver with a 100-nm multiplication layer, the PI method is found to be inaccurate for transmission rates beyond 20 Gb/s.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2302792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6725617&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6725617","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6725617","Approximation methods|Bit error rate|Educational institutions|Noise|Optical receivers|Photonics","Gaussian distribution|avalanche photodiodes|error statistics|intersymbol interference|optical receivers","","1"

Both resonators are designed to have identical responses at the desired resonant frequency of 494 MHz, while many of the spurious responses of the two resonators appear at nonidentical frequencies and do not add constructively at the filter output.

Wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs) are anticipated to be widely utilized in a wide range of smart-grid applications due to their numerous advantages along with their successful adoption in various critical areas including military and health. For resource-constrained WSANs, transmitting delay-critical data from smart-grid assets calls for data prioritization and delay responsiveness. In this paper, we introduce two medium-access approaches, namely, delay-responsive cross-layer (DRX) data transmission and fair and delay-aware cross-layer (FDRX) data transmission, which aim to address the delay and service requirements of smart grids. DRX is based on delay-estimation and data-prioritization steps that are performed by the application layer, in addition to the MAC layer parameters responding to the delay requirements of the smart-grid application and the network condition. On the other hand, FDRX incorporates fairness into DRX by preventing a few nodes from dominating the communication channel. We provide a comprehensive performance evaluation of those approaches. We show that DRX reduces the end-to-end delay while FDRX has lower collision rate compared with DRX. We outline the tradeoffs regarding these approaches and draw future research directions for robust communication protocols for smart-grid monitoring applications.","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2260939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6607219&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6607219","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1932-8184","6607219","Delays|IEEE 802.15 Standards|Monitoring|Multiaccess communication|Reliability|Smart grids|Wireless sensor networks","access protocols|data communication|delay estimation|power system measurement|smart power grids|wireless channels|wireless sensor networks","","1"

In our previous paper, we discussed the principle of the gait algorithm used by our PMV, in which wheels are utilized as legs to negotiate obstacles. In the original algorithm, when the wheels encountered terrain that might require leg motion to traverse, the system determined whether such motion was applicable and, if it was, orchestrated a series of leg motions. However, there were terrains that could not be negotiated using the original algorithm.

The significant improvements in the yield estimation suggest that PF-based crop model data assimilation is feasible.

In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift in the research of decision trees: instead of proposing a new manually designed method for inducing decision trees, we propose automatically designing decision-tree induction algorithms tailored to a specific type of classification data set (or application domain). Following recent breakthroughs in the automatic design of machine learning algorithms, we propose a hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm called hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm for designing decision-tree algorithms (HEAD-DT) that evolves design components of top-down decision-tree induction algorithms. By the end of the evolution, we expect HEAD-DT to generate a new and possibly better decision-tree algorithm for a given application domain. We perform extensive experiments in 35 real-world microarray gene expression data sets to assess the performance of HEAD-DT, and compare it with very well known decision-tree algorithms such as C4.5, CART, and REPTree. Results show that HEAD-DT is capable of generating algorithms that significantly outperform the baseline manually designed decision-tree algorithms regarding predictive accuracy and F-measure.","10.1109/TEVC.2013.2291813","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6670778&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6670778","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1089-778X","6670778","Accuracy|Algorithm design and analysis|Decision trees|Evolutionary computation|Machine learning algorithms|Prediction algorithms|Training","biology computing|decision trees|evolutionary computation|genetics|learning (artificial intelligence)|pattern classification","","1"

In the current fiscal atmosphere of sequestration and budget deficits, efficiency is critical for test and evaluation. In this paper, we review and compare sequential methods, estimators, and stopping criteria used in the DoD to those found in literature.

Pulse propagation simulations are implemented, and the pulse delay/advance is studied for wavelengths between the two resonances. As the density of injected free carriers increases, a continuous transition from fast to slow light occurs for a range of wavelengths. Consequently, a microdisk resonator in silicon is experimentally realized with the desired two resonances, exhibiting electrooptical tuning with a fast response.

The aim of this study was to design and clinically evaluate a system that integrates a control algorithm with off-the-shelf subcutaneous sensors and pumps to automate the delivery of the hormones glucagon and insulin in response to continuous glucose sensor measurements. The automated component of the system runs an adaptive proportional derivative control algorithm which determines hormone delivery rates based on the sensed glucose measurements and the meal announcements by the patient. We provide details about the system design and the control algorithm, which incorporates both a fading memory proportional derivative controller (FMPD) and an adaptive system for estimating changing sensitivity to insulin based on a glucoregulatory model of insulin action. For an inpatient study carried out in eight subjects using Dexcom SEVEN PLUS sensors, prestudy HbA1c averaged 7.6, which translates to an estimated average glucose of 171 mg/dL. In contrast, during use of the automated system, after initial stabilization, glucose averaged 145 mg/dL and subjects were kept within the euglycemic range (between 70 and 180 mg/dL) for 73.1% of the time, indicating improved glycemic control. A further study on five additional subjects in which we used a newer and more reliable glucose sensor (Dexcom G4 PLATINUM) and made improvements to the insulin and glucagon pump communication system resulted in elimination of hypoglycemic events. For this G4 study, the system was able to maintain subjects' glucose levels within the near-euglycemic range for 71.6% of the study duration and the mean venous glucose level was 151 mg/dL.","10.1109/TBME.2014.2323248","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6814769&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6814769","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-9294","6814769","Adaptation models|Equations|Insulin|Mathematical model|Sensitivity|Sensors|Sugar","PD control|artificial organs|biomedical measurement|blood|medical control systems|sensors|sugar","","1"

In this paper, we aim to evaluate trackers systematically and experimentally on 315 video fragments covering above aspects. We selected a set of nineteen trackers to include a wide variety of algorithms often cited in literature, supplemented with trackers appearing in 2010 and 2011 for which the code was publicly available.

Thus, two major objectives are considered for next-generation PONs (NG-PONs), i.e., first, bandwidth increase, and second, reach extension to reduce deployment costs. Here, we describe a new reach extension scheme that at the same time allows increasing the number of subscribers in the network. The amplification technique is based on a bidirectional semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). It is shown that the extender configuration not only meets the bandwidth and budget requirements for NG-PONs but also remarkably improves them. Differential (quadrature) phase-shift keying (D(Q)PSK) signals are investigated in this paper. Hybrid wavelength-division multiplexing/time-division multiplexing (WDM/TDM) transmission up to 120-Gb/s downstream and 40-Gb/s upstream are experimentally demonstrated. The access budget of 33.4 dB is achieved at 10 Gb/s on every WDM channel in case of DPSK enabling a splitting ratio of 1:512 per wavelength. Furthermore, optical power budget of 40 dB is obtained when DQPSK is used, where a splitting ratio of 1024 per wavelength can be supported. Additionally, a cost-efficient chirped managed directly modulated laser scheme is proposed for DPSK signal generation in U.S. scenario enabling a high-power budget performance low-cost transmitter configuration, which appears suitable for NG-PON application. The proposed technique also alleviates nonlinear impairments [specifically, cross-phase modulation (XPM)], which appear in dense WDM transmission.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2314108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779654&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779654","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6779654","Optical network units|Optical receivers|Optical transmitters|Passive optical networks|Semiconductor optical amplifiers|Time division multiplexing|Wavelength division multiplexing","chirp modulation|differential phase shift keying|next generation networks|optical transmitters|passive optical networks|quadrature phase shift keying|semiconductor optical amplifiers|subscriber loops|time division multiplexing|wavelength division multiplexing","","1"

We evaluate the impact of our strategy by calculating the power consumption of IPTV delivered over an IP-over-WDM network, considering both standard definition and high definition TV. Caches are used to reduce energy consumption by storing the most popular programs at nodes closer to the end user. We then use our knowledge of viewing behaviors to generate a time-driven content replacement strategy to maximize cache hit ratios and minimize energy use. We develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to evaluate the power consumption of the network while performing time-driven content replacements on caches and validate the results by simulation. Finally, we extend our model to perform content replacements on caches with sleep-mode capabilities which can save power by reducing their size. Our results show that time-based content replacements with such variable caches increase cache hit ratios and so reduces the overall power consumption by up to 86% compared to no caching. Our findings also show that more power savings are achieved for high definition TV compared to standard definition TV, so this strategy will be beneficial in the long term.","10.1109/JLT.2014.2324634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6817544&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6817544","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0733-8724","6817544","HDTV|IP networks|IPTV|Power demand|Streaming media|Wavelength division multiplexing","IPTV|cache storage|energy conservation|high definition television","","1"

Nitinol is a shape-memory alloy (SMA) with excellent strain recovery, durability, corrosion resistance, and fatigue strength. Although it has been incorporated in many applications, the implementation of nitinol, or any of the SMAs, in power ultrasonic applications is limited. Nitinol exhibits two phenomena, the first being the superelastic effect and the second being the shape-memory effect (SME). This paper assesses two cymbal transducers, one assembled with superelastic nitinol end caps and the other with shape-memory nitinol end caps. Characterization of the nitinol alloy before the design of such transducers is vital, so that they can be tuned to the desired operating frequencies.

The explicit benefit of the proposed scheme's universal DSM framework is ability to strike a balance between previous DSM schemes, such as the symbol-based and the block-based DSM schemes.

However, in addition to the gigabyte-size images and nonrigid distortions present in the tissue, a major challenge for registering differently stained histology image pairs is the dissimilar structural appearance due to different stains highlighting different substances in tissues. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing an unsupervised content classification method that generates multichannel probability images from a roughly aligned image pair. Each channel corresponds to one automatically identified content class. The probability images enhance the structural similarity between image pairs. By integrating the classification method into a multiresolution-block-matching-based nonrigid registration scheme (N. Roberts, D. Magee, Y. Song, K. Brabazon, M. Shires, D. Crellin, N. Orsi, P.

Evaluation was conducted on 77 histological image pairs taken from three liver specimens and one intervertebral disc specimen. In total, six types of histochemical stains were tested. We evaluated our method against the same registration method implemented without applying the classification algorithm (intensity-based registration) and the state-of-the-art mutual information based registration.

Gastrointestinal diseases are mainly based on morphological abnormalities. However, gastrointestinal symptoms are sometimes apparent without visible abnormalities. One of the major factors for these diseases is abnormal gastrointestinal motility. For assessment of gastric motility, a gastric motility imaging system is needed. To assess the dynamic motility of the stomach, the proposed system measures 3-D gastric contractions derived from a 3-D profile of the stomach wall obtained with a developed 3-D endoscope. After obtaining contraction waves, their frequency, amplitude, and speed of propagation can be calculated using a Gaussian function. The proposed system was evaluated for 3-D measurements of several objects with known geometries. The results showed that the surface profiles could be obtained with an error of &lt;;10% of the distance between two different points on images. Subsequently, we evaluated the validity of a prototype system using a wave simulated model. In the experiment, the amplitude and position of waves could be measured with 1-mm accuracy. The present results suggest that the proposed system can measure the speed and amplitude of contractions. This system has low invasiveness and can assess the motility of the stomach wall directly in a 3-D manner.

The proposed approach utilizes the complementary edge information in the multiple structural MRI modalities. It combines optimally selected two modalities from susceptibility-weighted, T<sub>2</sub>-weighted, and diffusion MRI, and introduces a tailored new edge indicator function. In addition to this, we employ prior shape and configuration knowledge of the subcortical structures in order to guide the evolution of geometric active surfaces. Neighboring structures are segmented iteratively, constraining oversegmentation at their borders with a nonoverlapping penalty. Several experiments with data acquired on a 7 T MRI scanner demonstrate the feasibility and power of the approach for the segmentation of basal ganglia components critical for neurosurgery applications such as deep brain stimulation surgery.","10.1109/JBHI.2013.2292858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6676825&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6676825","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2194","6676825","Basal ganglia|Computational modeling|Image edge detection|Image segmentation|Laplace equations|Magnetic resonance imaging|Shape","biomedical MRI|brain|image segmentation|medical image processing|surgery","","1"

When these schemes are applied to transmit bitstreams with multiple BER requirements, low resource utilization will occur since the target BER has to be the strictest one. We develop a BER-driven resource allocation for generic bitstreams (BRA-G) algorithm by exploiting multiple predetermined target BERs. Then, this scheme is extended to transmission of realistic scalable bitstreams (BRA-SB) where more important (MI) layers possess lower target BERs as compared with less important (LI) layers. The objective here is to maximize the expected quality of all JPEG 2000 (J2K) scalable bitstreams subject to a total power constraint. Instead of using static target BERs for different layers, BRA-SB water-fills over all layers to determine the number of transmit layers and the target BER of each layer simultaneously based on the importance of each layer in terms of reconstructed quality and average channel conditions. Bit-level results show that BRA-SB provides significant image quality improvement over a scheme that ignores the layer's importance in terms of target BER and a BRA-SB-like scheme with static target BERs.

The absorption peak could be very high up to 90%. In the structure, the introduced periodical back grooves bring about different orders of transmission minima into the transmission spectrum, which are named as transmission minima introduced by back grooves (TMIBBGs) here. When TMIBBGs approach the Fabry-Pe&#x0301;rot (FP)-like resonant transmission peaks supported in the slits, the latter will be strongly suppressed. However, the reflection dips are almost unaffected. As a result, absorption is greatly enhanced. More interesting, the positions of TMIBBGs can be tuned by modulating the structural parameters of back grooves to selectively inhibit different orders of FP-like resonant transmission peaks and realize corresponding enhanced absorption, meanwhile, without influence to other orders of FP-like resonant transmissions. Moreover, due to the asymmetry of the structure, the enhanced absorption is unidirectional. The physical mechanisms are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in this paper.","10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2306833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746033&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746033","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1943-0655","6746033","Absorption|Gratings|Optical coupling|Optical polarization|Optical reflection|Structural engineering","Fabry-Perot resonators|diffraction gratings|light transmission|metallic thin films|plasmonics","","1"

First, an HVS size-adaptation process is used, and the IR image after preprocessing is divided into subblocks to improve detection speed. Then, based on HVS contrast mechanism, the improved local contrast measure, which can improve detection rate and reduce false alarm rate, is proposed to calculate the saliency map, and a threshold operation along with a rapid traversal mechanism based on HVS attention shift mechanism is used to get the target subblocks quickly.

The new model supports 3-D propagation, 3-D antenna patterns, time evolving channel traces of arbitrary length, scenario transitions and variable terminal speeds. We validated the model by measurements in a coherent LTE advanced testbed in downtown Berlin, Germany. We then reproduced the same scenario in the model and compared several channel parameters (delay spread, path gain, K-factor, geometry factor and capacity). The results match very well and we can accurately predict the performance for an urban macro-cell setup with commercial high-gain antennas. At the same time, the computational complexity does not increase significantly and we can use all existing WINNER parameter tables.

As typically occurs in body-centric communications channels, the dominant or line-of-sight (LOS) components are shadowed by body matter situated in the path trajectory. This situation may be further exacerbated due to physiological and biomechanical movements of the body. In the proposed model, the resultant dominant component which is formed by the phasor addition of these leading contributions is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution. A wide range of measured and simulated shadowed body-centric channels considering on-body, off-body and body-to-body communications are used to validate the model. During the course of the validation experiments, it was found that, even for environments devoid of multipath or specular reflections generated by the local surroundings, a noticeable resultant dominant component can still exist in body-centric channels where the user's body shadows the direct LOS signal path between the transmitter and the receiver.","10.1109/TAP.2013.2295211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687207&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687207","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","0018-926X","6687207","Antenna measurements|Communication channels|Equations|Fading|Mathematical model|Shadow mapping|Wireless communication","body area networks|fading channels|log normal distribution|multipath channels|statistical analysis","","1"

Besides simplifying our daily lives, the MTC business represents a promising market for mobile operators to increase their revenues. However, before a complete deployment of MTC over mobile networks, there is need to update the specifications of mobile networks in order to cope with the expected high number (massive deployment) of MTC devices. Indeed, large scale deployment of MTC devices represents an important challenge as a high number of MTC devices, simultaneously connecting to the mobile network, may cause congestion and system overload, which can degrade the network performance and even result in network node failures. Several activities have been led by 3GPP to alleviate system overload introduced by MTC. Most of the devised approaches represent only incremental solutions. Unlike these solutions, we devise a complete new architectural vision to support MTC in mobile networks. This vision relies on the marriage of mobile networks and cloud computing, specifically exploiting recent advances in network function virtualization (NFV). The aim of the proposed vision, namely LightEPC, is: 1) to orchestrate the on-demand creation of cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks dedicated for MTC and 2) to simplify the network attach procedure for MTC devices by creating only one NFV MTC function that groups all the usual procedures. By doing so, LightEPC is able to create and scale instances of NFV MTC functions on demand and in an elastic manner to cope with any sudden increase in traffic generated by MTC devices. To evaluate LightEPC, some preliminary analysis were conducted and the obtained analytical results indicate the ability of LightEPC in alleviating congestion and scaling up fast with massive numbers of MTC devices in mobile networks. Finally, a real-life implementation of LightEPC on top of cloud platform is discussed.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2359649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6906244&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906244","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6906244","Logic gates|Machine-to-machine communications|Mobile communication|Mobile computing|Object recognition|Protocols|Radio access networks|Servers","3G mobile communication|cloud computing|mobile computing|telecommunication traffic|virtualisation","","1"

In this respect, the development of automatic segmentation methods that can accurately, reliably, and reproducibly segment the HC has attracted considerable attention over the past decades. This paper presents an innovative 3-D fully automatic method to be used on top of the multiatlas concept for the HC segmentation. The method is based on a subject-specific set of 3-D optimal local maps (OLMs) that locally control the influence of each energy term of a hybrid active contour model (ACM). The complete set of the OLMs for a set of training images is defined simultaneously via an optimization scheme. At the same time, the optimal ACM parameters are also calculated. Therefore, heuristic parameter fine-tuning is not required. Training OLMs are subsequently combined, by applying an extended multiatlas concept, to produce the OLMs that are anatomically more suitable to the test image. The proposed algorithm was tested on three different and publicly available data sets. Its accuracy was compared with that of state-of-the-art methods demonstrating the efficacy and robustness of the proposed method.","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2297953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702429&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6702429","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2372","6702429","Active appearance model|Active contours|Algorithm design and analysis|Biomedical imaging|Hippocampus|Image edge detection|Image segmentation|Solid modeling","biomedical MRI|brain|image segmentation|medical disorders|medical image processing|optimisation","","1"

This review summarizes the current understanding of this issue, and some of the complexities in comparing the absorption of RF energy in different individuals from use of mobile phones. The discussion is limited to dosimetric issues, i.e., possible age-related differences in absorption of RF energy in the heads of mobile phone users. For most metrics of exposure, in particular those relevant to assessing the compliance of handsets with regulatory limits, there is no clear evidence for age-related differences in exposure. For two metrics of exposure, there is a clear evidence that age can play a factor: 1) the local specific absorption rate (SAR), in particular anatomically defined locations within the brain, will vary with head size and hence with age and 2) the SAR, in particular tissues, (e.g., bone marrow in the skull) can vary with age due to age-related differences in the dielectric properties of tissue. However, these differences involve SAR levels that are below the 1-g or 10-g peak spatial SAR (psSAR averaged over 1 or 10 g of tissue) and have no significance for compliance assessment. Age-related differences observed in worst case simulations such as presently considered are difficult to generalize to human populations under real-world exposure conditions due to many variables that determine SAR during realistic usages.","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2380355","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982034&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6982034","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2169-3536","6982034","Hazards|Magnetic heads|Mobile handsets|Pediatrics|Radiation effects|Radio frequency|Specific absorption rate","bioelectric phenomena|bone|brain|dielectric properties|dosimetry|mobile handsets|paediatrics","","1"

Basic system identification was completed, and a control algorithm for the robot based on pressure control was designed and tested. The subjects had greater root-mean-square error for position and velocity variables during the custom exercise tasks. These results suggest that the custom task was difficult to complete, possibly because the neural network was unconstrained. Finally, the robot prototype was able to mimic changes in a subject's elbow angle in real time, demonstrating the feasibility of the robotic rehabilitation system.","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2314097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779647&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779647","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-2372","6779647","Electromyography|Musculoskeletal sysgem|Patient rehabilitation|Robot sensing systems|Three-dimensional displays|Visualization","adaptive systems|biomechanics|electromyography|manipulators|mean square error methods|medical disorders|medical robotics|neural nets|patient rehabilitation|pressure control|sensors","","1"

Yet, when compared with single-view video coding, MVC consumes much more time when encoding large amounts of data. Speed-up algorithms, therefore, are essential for realizing related applications. This paper presents a fast mode decision algorithm to avoid the high computational complexity of MVC. The proposed approach aims to reduce candidate modes and make mode decision process more efficient. The minimum and maximum values of rate-distortion cost (RD cost) in the previously encoded view are used to compute a threshold for each mode in the current view.

This motivates the proposal of an emerging wireless communications concept conceived for single-radio-frequency (RF) large-scale MIMO communications, which is termed as SM. The concept of SM has established itself as a beneficial transmission paradigm, subsuming numerous members of the MIMO system family.

Furthermore, it has received sufficient research attention to be implemented in testbeds, and it holds the promise of stimulating further vigorous interdisciplinary research in the years to come. This tutorial paper is intended to offer a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey on SM-MIMO research, to provide a critical appraisal of its potential advantages, and to promote the discussion of its beneficial application areas and their research challenges leading to the analysis of the technological issues associated with the implementation of SM-MIMO.

In fact, when we apply NIST's statistical test suite for randomness against the random sequences generated from a population of 125 ring oscillator PUFs using classic 1-out-of-8 coding and neighbor coding, none of them can pass all the tests. In this paper, we propose to decouple the unwanted systematic variation from the desired random variation through a regression-based distiller, where the basic idea is to build a model for the systematic variation so we can generate the random sequences only from the true random variation. Applying neighbor coding to the same benchmark data, our experiment shows that second- and third-order polynomials distill random sequences that pass all the NIST randomness tests. So does fourth-order polynomial in the case of 1-out-of-8 coding. Finally, we introduce two generic random sequence generation methods. The sequences they generate fail all the randomness tests, but with the help of our proposed polynomial distiller, all but one tests are passed.

A quantum channel is PD if the channel output can be used to simulate the degraded environment state. The PD channels could exist both in the degradable, antidegradable and conjugate degradable family. We define the term partial simulation, which is a clear benefit that arises from the structure of the complementary channel of a PD channel.

We also introduce a novel approximation to alleviate the computational complexity of the proposed models. This paper points out the inconsistency of several assumptions that are typically used for performance analysis of CR networks and reveals that channel fading on the relaying links yields similar performance degradations as on the sensing channel. The study also shows that it is not necessary to incorporate all CRs in the cooperative process and that a small number of reliable radios are enough to achieve practical detection level.

Traditional centralized estimation often requires global inference of the covariance matrix, which can be computationally intensive in large dimensions. Approximate inference based on message-passing algorithms, on the other hand, can lead to unstable and biased estimation in loopy graphical models. Here, we propose a general framework for distributed estimation based on a maximum marginal likelihood (MML) approach. This approach computes local parameter estimates by maximizing marginal likelihoods defined with respect to data collected from local neighborhoods. Due to the non-convexity of the MML problem, we introduce and solve a convex relaxation. The local estimates are then combined into a global estimate without the need for iterative message-passing between neighborhoods. The proposed algorithm is naturally parallelizable and computationally efficient, thereby making it suitable for high-dimensional problems. In the classical regime where the number of variables p is fixed and the number of samples T increases to infinity, the proposed estimator is shown to be asymptotically consistent and to improve monotonically as the local neighborhood size increases.

However, existing layer assignment approaches have largely ignored these variations, which can lead to significant timing violations. To address this issue, a variation-aware layer assignment approach for cost minimization is proposed in this paper. The proposed layer assignment approach is a single-stage stochastic program that directly controls the timing yield via a single parameter, and it is solved using Monte Carlo simulations and the Latin hypercube sampling technique. A hierarchical design is also adopted to enable the optimization process on a multicore platform. Experiments have been performed on 5000 industrial nets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach: 1) can significantly improve the timing yield by 64% in comparison with the nominal design and 2) can reduce the wire cost by 15.7% in comparison with the worst case design.","10.1109/TETC.2014.2316503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6786337&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786337","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","2168-6750","6786337","Capacitance|Large-scale systems|Nanoscale devices|Programming|Stochastic processes|Very large scale integration","Monte Carlo methods|VLSI|logic design|multiprocessing systems|sampling methods|stochastic programming","","1"

In this work, we investigate different classification strategies for individual and simultaneous movements based on pattern recognition of myoelectric signals. Our results suggest that any classifier can be potentially employed in the prediction of simultaneous movements if arranged in a distributed topology. On the other hand, classifiers inherently capable of simultaneous predictions, such as the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were found to be more cost effective, as they can be successfully employed in their simplest form. In the prediction of individual movements, the one-vs-one (OVO) topology was found to improve classification accuracy across different classifiers and it was therefore used to benchmark the benefits of simultaneous control. As opposed to previous work reporting only offline accuracy, the classification performance and the resulting controllability are evaluated in real time using the motion test and target achievement control (TAC) test, respectively. We propose a simultaneous classification strategy based on MLP that outperformed a top classifier for individual movements (LDA-OVO), thus improving the state-of-the-art classification approach.

An ultralightweight rigid frame wheelchair was instrumented with two axle-mounted encoders and data acquisition equipment to accurately measure the velocity of the drive wheels. A mathematical model was created combining physical specifications and geometry of the wheelchair and its components. Two able-bodied subjects propelled the wheelchair over four courses that involved straight and turning maneuvers at differing speeds. The KE of the wheelchair was divided into three components: translational, rotational, and turning energy. This technique was sensitive to the changing contributions of the three energy components across maneuvers. Translational energy represented the major component of total KE in all maneuvers except a zero radius turn in which turning energy was dominant. Both translational and rotational energies are directly related to wheelchair speed. Partitioning KE offers a useful means of investigating the dynamics of a moving wheelchair. The described technique permits analysis of KE imparted to the wheelchair during maneuvers involving changes in speed and direction, which are most representative of mobility in everyday life. This technique can be used to study the effort required to maneuver different types and configurations of wheelchairs.","10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2289378","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6656838&contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6656838","Journals & Magazines","IEEE","","1534-4320","6656838","Acceleration|Kinematics|Manuals|Propulsion|Turning|Wheelchairs|Wheels","biomedical equipment|biomedical measurement|data acquisition|handicapped aids|patient rehabilitation|velocity measurement|wheelchairs","","1"

For an incident ordinary ray, the output beam size remains the same as that of the incident beam, which results in low coupling efficiency. For an incident extraordinary ray (e-ray), the output beam size is close to the size of the fiber core, giving rise to high coupling efficiency because of the lens effect. Moreover, the output beam size of the e-ray can be electrically controlled, thus allowing the optical attenuation to be manipulated. In our experiments, the polarization-dependent loss from the visible to the near-infrared spectral region was approximately 12 dB.
